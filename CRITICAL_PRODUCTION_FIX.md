# 🚨 CRITICAL PRODUCTION FIX: Authentication Routes Missing

## Root Cause Found
The production server (`server/production-deployment.ts`) was missing route registration calls. The GitHub Actions deployment built successfully but the authentication endpoints were not registered.

## Fix Applied
Added missing calls in production-deployment.ts:
- ✅ `setupGoogleAuth(app)` - Registers /api/login, /api/logout, /auth/google, /api/me
- ✅ `registerAllRoutes(app)` - Registers all other API endpoints

## Deployment Required
Since I cannot commit to GitHub directly from this environment, you need to:

### Option 1: Manual Commit & Push
```bash
git add server/production-deployment.ts
git commit -m "🔧 Fix production authentication routes"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Copy the Fixed Code
Copy this code to your `server/production-deployment.ts` around line 72-80:

```typescript
// Setup Google Authentication BEFORE other routes
console.log('🔐 Setting up Google authentication...');
setupGoogleAuth(app);
console.log('✅ Authentication configured');

// Setup all API routes BEFORE static file serving and SPA fallback
console.log('🛣️ Registering API routes...');
registerAllRoutes(app);
console.log('✅ All API routes registered');
```

## After Deployment
Once GitHub Actions completes, these endpoints will work:
- `https://www.realmrivalry.com/api/login` ✅
- `https://www.realmrivalry.com/api/me` ✅  
- `https://www.realmrivalry.com/auth/google` ✅

## Why This Happened
The production server template was incomplete compared to the development server. The development server in `server/index.ts` calls both functions, but the production server was missing the route registration.
