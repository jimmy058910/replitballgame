git commit -m "Deploy: Comprehensive error handling + port binding analysis + all 5 deployment blocker fixes

✅ RESOLVED ISSUES:
1. IAM Service Account User role (GitHub Actions access)
2. Secret Manager permissions (Cloud Run service account)  
3. TypeScript ESM imports with .js extensions
4. Secret mapping: DATABASE_URL_PRODUCTION → DATABASE_URL
5. Auth setup: setupGoogleAuth() → setupGoogleAuth(passport)

✅ COMPREHENSIVE ERROR HANDLING:
- Phase-by-phase startup logging
- Complete try/catch wrapper around server startup
- Production port binding analysis (8080 vs 5000)
- Environment variable debugging

✅ LOCAL VALIDATION: Server starts successfully with all phases complete"
