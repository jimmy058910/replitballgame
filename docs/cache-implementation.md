# IN-MEMORY CACHE IMPLEMENTATION

## Overview
Simple in-memory caching system to reduce Neon database compute usage by 30-50%.

## Implementation Status
✅ Core cache system created (`server/utils/memoryCache.ts`)
✅ Cache middleware implemented (`server/middleware/cacheMiddleware.ts`)
✅ Cache management routes added (`server/routes/cacheRoutes.ts`)
✅ Cache setup utilities created (`server/utils/cacheSetup.ts`)
✅ Cache routes registered in main router

## Key Features
- **Automatic TTL**: 5-minute default, configurable per route
- **Smart Cleanup**: Expired entries removed every 2 minutes
- **Memory Limits**: Max 1000 entries with LRU eviction
- **Cache Statistics**: Hit rate, size, performance metrics
- **Pattern Invalidation**: Clear related cache entries on data updates

## Cache Configuration
- User profiles: 5 minutes
- Team data: 5 minutes
- Player lists: 3 minutes
- League standings: 8 minutes
- Season info: 15 minutes

## Expected Impact
- **Query Reduction**: 30-50% fewer database calls
- **Compute Savings**: Significant reduction in Neon branch usage
- **Response Time**: Faster API responses from cached data

## Management Endpoints
- `GET /api/cache/stats` - View cache performance
- `DELETE /api/cache/clear/all` - Clear all cache
- `DELETE /api/cache/clear/users` - Clear user cache
- `DELETE /api/cache/clear/teams` - Clear team cache

## Integration Notes
Cache system initializes automatically on server startup and begins reducing database load immediately.
