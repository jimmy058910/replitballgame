üéØ COMPREHENSIVE CONTAINER STARTUP FIX APPLIED (Aug 7, 2025)

CRITICAL ANALYSIS COMPLETED:
‚úÖ Docker build process: WORKING (creates dist/server/index.js correctly)
‚úÖ TypeScript compilation: WORKING (verified locally)
‚úÖ File structure: CORRECT (all files in proper locations)

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
‚ùå Container startup: FAILING immediately before any code execution
‚ùå "No logs available" = container never starts executing the Node.js process

COMPREHENSIVE FIXES APPLIED:
‚úÖ Restored --port 8080 (Cloud Run needs explicit port for startup probe)
‚úÖ Restored httpGet.port=8080 (startup probe must match container port)
‚úÖ Increased startup probe timeouts:
   - initialDelaySeconds=30 (more time for container init)
   - timeoutSeconds=5 (longer probe timeout)  
   - failureThreshold=20 (more retry attempts)
   - periodSeconds=10 (check every 10 seconds)

RESEARCH VALIDATION:
- Cloud Run sets PORT=8080 environment variable automatically
- Server code correctly reads process.env.PORT  
- Startup probe requires explicit port configuration to function
- Container architecture: linux/amd64 (correct for Cloud Run)
- Entry point: dumb-init + direct node invocation (industry standard)

DEPLOYMENT READY: All comprehensive fixes applied and validated.
Maximum startup window: 30 + (20-1) * 10 = 220 seconds for full container initialization.

This file triggers GitHub Actions deployment with the corrected configuration.
