# Step 5 Deployment Instructions

## Current Status
- ✅ Step 5 server corrected with real Realm Rivalry game mechanics (local)
- ✅ Step 5 Docker configuration ready (local)
- ✅ Step 5 workflow file ready (local)
- ❌ Files not yet committed/pushed to GitHub

## Why GitHub Actions doesn't show Step 5 workflow
The workflow file `.github/workflows/deploy-step5-websocket.yml` exists locally but hasn't been pushed to GitHub repository yet. GitHub Actions only shows workflows that are committed to the repository.

## Solution: Commit and Push Step 5 Files

To deploy Step 5, you need to commit these files:

```bash
# Add all Step 5 deployment files
git add server-realtime-step5.js
git add Dockerfile.step5-websocket  
git add .github/workflows/deploy-step5-websocket.yml

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Step 5: Real-Time Realm Rivalry Game Features

- Fixed authentic game mechanics (30min Exhibition, 40min League)
- 6v6 dome system with fantasy races (Human, Sylvan, Gryll, Lumina, Umbra)
- Real game events: scores, tackles, passes, blocks
- WebSocket live match simulation
- Fixed syntax errors and tested locally
- Ready for Cloud Run deployment as realm-rivalry-realtime"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

## What happens after push
1. GitHub Actions will show "Deploy Step 5 - Real-Time Game Features" workflow
2. The workflow will automatically trigger due to changed files
3. Step 5 will deploy to Cloud Run as `realm-rivalry-realtime`
4. You'll be able to manually trigger future deployments from GitHub interface

## Alternative: Manual trigger after push
Once the workflow is in GitHub, you can also trigger manually:
1. Go to https://github.com/jimmy058910/replitballgame/actions
2. Click "Deploy Step 5 - Real-Time Game Features"
3. Click "Run workflow" → Select "main" → "Run workflow"

## Files Ready for Deployment
- `server-realtime-step5.js` - Corrected real-time game server
- `Dockerfile.step5-websocket` - Docker configuration
- `.github/workflows/deploy-step5-websocket.yml` - Deployment workflow
