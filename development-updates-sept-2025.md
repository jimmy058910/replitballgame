## Critical Statistics Fix - Orphaned Games Resolution

### Issue Summary
Successfully resolved a critical bug where team statistics were incorrectly calculated due to orphaned games from previous seasons being included in win/loss records.

### Technical Details

#### **Root Cause**
The `TeamStatisticsCalculator` was counting ALL historical games for a team, not just current season games. Games without a `scheduleId` (orphaned from previous seasons) were being incorrectly included in statistics calculations.

#### **Solution Implemented**
Updated `server/utils/teamStatisticsCalculator.ts` to filter out orphaned games:

```typescript
// Line 66 - CRITICAL: Only include games with valid scheduleId
const completedGames = await prisma.game.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      { homeTeamId: teamId },
      { awayTeamId: teamId }
    ],
    matchType: 'LEAGUE',
    scheduleId: { not: null }, // Filter out orphaned games from old seasons
    // ... rest of query
  }
});
```

#### **Impact**
- Oakland Cougars was showing 1W-0D-1L (should be 1W-0D-0L)
- Orphaned game ID 12591 from previous season (10-16 loss) was being counted
- All team statistics were potentially affected

### Database Integrity Improvements

1. **Orphaned Games Cleanup**
   - Removed 285 orphaned games from previous seasons
   - Verified all current season games have valid `scheduleId` associations

2. **Future Games Data Fix**
   - Reset 52 future games with incorrect 0-0 scores to NULL
   - Ensured only completed games have scores

3. **UserProfile Associations**
   - Fixed Oakland Cougars team association with UserProfile
   - Verified Firebase UID → UserProfile → Team chain

### Key Learnings & Documentation

#### **Server Restart Requirements**
When making backend changes during development with `tsx`:
- Server does NOT automatically hot-reload for all changes
- Must manually restart server when changing core services
- Kill existing process: `npx kill-port 3000` or kill the bash process
- Restart: `npm run dev:local`

#### **UserProfile vs userId Architecture**
Important distinction in database schema:
- `Team` model has `userProfileId` (NOT `userId`)
- `UserProfile` model has `userId` (Firebase UID)
- Two-tier association: Firebase UID → UserProfile → Team
- Development mode uses `'dev-user-123'` as Firebase UID

#### **Database Integrity Best Practices**
Always verify when debugging statistics issues:
1. Check for orphaned games: `WHERE scheduleId IS NULL`
2. Verify current season games only have valid scheduleId
3. Use `ensureUserProfiles.ts` script to verify team associations
4. Clear orphaned games when transitioning seasons

### Files Modified

1. **`server/utils/teamStatisticsCalculator.ts`**
   - Added `scheduleId: { not: null }` filter for orphaned games
   - Enhanced logging for debugging

2. **`server/routes/leagueRoutes.ts`**
   - Fixed team undefined error (line 1121)
   - Changed `team?.division` → `userTeam?.division`

3. **`client/src/components/ComprehensiveCompetitionCenter.tsx`**
   - Fixed games remaining calculation (line 778)
   - Changed from `14 - (currentDay - 1)` to `14 - currentDay`

4. **Temporary Scripts (created and deleted)**
   - `fix-future-game-scores.cjs` - Reset future game scores
   - `cleanup-orphaned-games.cjs` - Removed orphaned games
   - `revert-userprofile.cjs` - Restored UserProfile associations

### Results

✅ **Oakland Cougars now correctly shows**: 1W - 0D - 0L with 3 points  
✅ **Only current season games counted** in statistics  
✅ **13 games remaining** correctly calculated  
✅ **All standings accurate** for Division 7 Alpha  

### Next Steps

1. Monitor statistics calculations after season transitions
2. Consider adding automated cleanup of orphaned games
3. Implement validation to prevent future games from having scores
4. Add health check for UserProfile associations
