## Core Game Mechanics & Systems

### 1. Player Generation & Attributes
**Attribute Scale**: All 8 player attributes (Speed, Power, Throwing, Catching, Kicking, Stamina, Leadership, Agility) use a 1-40 scale with racial modifiers applied after base generation (final cap of 40).

**Racial Modifiers**:
- **Human**: +1 to all stats
- **Sylvan**: +3 Speed, +4 Agility, -2 Power
- **Gryll**: +5 Power, +3 Stamina, -3 Speed, -2 Agility
- **Lumina**: +4 Throwing, +3 Leadership, -1 Stamina
- **Umbra**: +2 Speed, +3 Agility, -3 Power, -1 Leadership

**Rookie Generation (Tryouts)**:
- **Age**: 16-20 years old
- **Potential**: Single overall rating on 10-point scale (0.5 to 5 stars)
- **Total Attribute Points (TAP)**: BasePoints + (PotentialRating Ã— 4)
  - Basic Tryout BasePoints: 40-60
  - Advanced Tryout BasePoints: 60-85
- **Point Distribution**: 3 baseline to each attribute (24 total), remaining TAP distributed by role (60% primary stats, 40% secondary)

**Free Agent Generation**: Ages 18-35 with wider TAP variance for hidden gems and veterans.

### 2. Player Progression, Aging & Retirement
**Daily Progression (3 AM Reset)**: Each player has small chance (1% + AgeModifier) to gain +1 in random eligible attribute.

**End-of-Season Progression (Day 17)**: Primary development event with ProgressionChance calculated as:
`BaseChance + PotentialModifier + AgeModifier + UsageModifier + TrainerBonus`

**Age-Related Decline**: Players 31+ have chance to lose 1 point in physical stats (Speed, Agility, Power).
`DeclineChance = (player.age - 30) Ã— 2.5%`

**Retirement System**: Players 35+ have retirement chance, automatic at age 45.
`RetirementChance = BaseAgeChance + (CareerInjuries Ã— 2%) + LowPlayingTimeModifier`

### 4. Power & Camaraderie Calculations

*Note: Stamina and Leadership attributes affect other game systems but are excluded from Power calculation*

**Team Power**: Average Power rating of top 9 players on roster, assigned descriptive tier (Foundation, Developing, Competitive, Contender, Elite)

**Team Camaraderie**: Average of individual player camaraderie scores, updated end-of-season based on team success, player loyalty (years on team), and Head Coach leadership

### 5. Stadium, Finance & Atmosphere
**Fan Loyalty (0-100)**: Persistent team score updated end-of-season, influenced by win percentage, championships, and stadium facilities (Lighting, Screens)
