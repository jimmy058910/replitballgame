## Core Game Mechanics & Systems

### 1. Player Generation & Attributes
**Attribute Scale**: All 8 player attributes (Speed, Power, Throwing, Catching, Kicking, Stamina, Leadership, Agility) use a 1-40 scale with racial modifiers applied after base generation (final cap of 40).

**Racial Modifiers**:
- **Human**: +1 to all stats
- **Sylvan**: +3 Speed, +4 Agility, -2 Power
- **Gryll**: +5 Power, +3 Stamina, -3 Speed, -2 Agility
- **Lumina**: +4 Throwing, +3 Leadership, -1 Stamina
- **Umbra**: +2 Speed, +3 Agility, -3 Power, -1 Leadership

**Rookie Generation (Tryouts)**:
- **Age**: 16-20 years old
- **Potential**: Single overall rating on 10-point scale (0.5 to 5 stars)
- **Total Attribute Points (TAP)**: BasePoints + (PotentialRating × 4)
  - Basic Tryout BasePoints: 40-60
  - Advanced Tryout BasePoints: 60-85
- **Point Distribution**: 3 baseline to each attribute (24 total), remaining TAP distributed by role (60% primary stats, 40% secondary)

**Free Agent Generation**: Ages 18-35 with wider TAP variance for hidden gems and veterans.

### 2. Player Progression, Aging & Retirement
**Daily Progression (3 AM Reset)**: Each player has small chance (1% + AgeModifier) to gain +1 in random eligible attribute.

**End-of-Season Progression (Day 17)**: Primary development event with ProgressionChance calculated as:
`BaseChance + PotentialModifier + AgeModifier + UsageModifier + TrainerBonus`

**Age-Related Decline**: Players 31+ have chance to lose 1 point in physical stats (Speed, Agility, Power).
`DeclineChance = (player.age - 30) × 2.5%`

**Retirement System**: Players 35+ have retirement chance, automatic at age 45.
`RetirementChance = BaseAgeChance + (CareerInjuries × 2%) + LowPlayingTimeModifier`

### 3. Staff System & Effects
**Staff Attributes**: All staff use 1-40 scale with specific roles:
- **Head Coach** (Motivation, Development): Increases BaseChance for player progression, boosts trainer effectiveness, contributes to Team Camaraderie
- **Trainers** (Teaching): Provide TrainerBonus to ProgressionChance for specific attribute groups during end-of-season development
- **Recovery Specialist** (Physiology): Increases Injury Recovery Points healed per day
- **Scouts** (Talent_Identification, Potential_Assessment): Reduce "fog of war" for tryout and marketplace player evaluations

### 4. Power & Camaraderie Calculations
**Player Power (CAR)**: Core Athleticism Rating displayed as "Power" in UI
`Power (CAR) = Average(Speed, Power, Agility, Throwing, Catching, Kicking)`

**Team Power**: Average Power rating of top 9 players on roster, assigned descriptive tier (Foundation, Developing, Competitive, Contender, Elite)

**Team Camaraderie**: Average of individual player camaraderie scores, updated end-of-season based on team success, player loyalty (years on team), and Head Coach leadership

### 5. Stadium, Finance & Atmosphere
**Fan Loyalty (0-100)**: Persistent team score updated end-of-season, influenced by win percentage, championships, and stadium facilities (Lighting, Screens)

**Attendance Rate**: Primarily driven by FanLoyalty with small bonus for winning streaks
`Actual Attendance = StadiumCapacity × AttendanceRate`

**Revenue Calculation (Per Home Game)**:
- Ticket Sales: ActualAttendance × 25₡
- Concessions: ActualAttendance × 8₡ × ConcessionsLevel
- Parking: (ActualAttendance × 0.3) × 10₡ × ParkingLevel
- Apparel Sales: ActualAttendance × 3₡ × MerchandisingLevel
- VIP Suites: VIPSuitesLevel × 5000₡
- Atmosphere Bonus: Small credit bonus per attendee if FanLoyalty very high

**Home Field Advantage**: Intimidation Factor based on ActualAttendance and FanLoyalty applies temporary debuff to away team's Catching/Throwing stats

### 6. Marketplace & Store
**Marketplace Rules**:
- 10-player roster minimum requirement
- 3-player listing limit per team
- 2% listing fee on starting bid
- Anti-sniping system with 5-minute extensions
- Buy-now pricing formula: (Player CAR × 1000) + (Potential × 2000)

**Store System (No Pay-to-Win)**:
- All gameplay-affecting items (equipment, consumables) available for Credits
- Gem-exclusive items are purely cosmetic (e.g., "Helm of Command")
- **Credit Store**: Daily rotating Common/Uncommon items
- **Featured Store**: Daily rotating Rare/Epic/Legendary items for Gems or high Credits
- **Race-Specific Equipment**: Thematic gear matching the 5 fantasy races
- **Consumables**: Recovery items and single-game performance boosters only
