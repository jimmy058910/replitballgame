## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Git Analysis
1. **Retrieve Git Status**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **List Modified Files**
   ```bash
   git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD
   ```

3. **Show Recent Commits**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   ```

4. **Generate Diff Content**
   ```bash
   git diff HEAD~1 HEAD
   ```

### Phase 2: Design Review Execution

**Objective:** Conduct thorough design review using specialized design review agent, following design principles and style guide from context documents.

**Agent Instructions:**
```
You are now acting as the Design Review Agent for Realm Rivalry. 

Please conduct a comprehensive design review of the changes identified in the git analysis above.

**Key Focus Areas:**
1. Mobile-first functionality (test 375px viewport first)
2. Credit display format compliance ("amountâ‚¡" - NEVER "â‚¡amount")
3. 5-hub navigation architecture
4. Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)
5. Fantasy sports UI authenticity
6. Touch target sizing (â‰¥44px)

**Review Process:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
2. Check console for errors
3. Test across multiple viewports (mobile, tablet, desktop)
4. Validate against /context/design-principles.md standards
5. Check adherence to /context/style-guide.md
6. Screenshot evidence for issues found
7. Generate detailed report with prioritized findings

**Report Structure:**
- Executive Summary
- Tested Environments
- Blockers (ðŸš¨)
- High Priority Issues (ðŸ”´)  
- Medium Priority Issues (ðŸŸ¡)
- Nitpicks (ðŸ”µ)
- Strengths (âœ…)
- Evidence Screenshots
- Actionable Recommendations

Please begin the review now, starting with environment setup and navigation.
```

### Phase 3: Action Planning

**Post-Review Tasks:**
1. Create TodoWrite items for any blockers found
2. Prioritize fixes based on user impact
3. Document any design system updates needed
4. Plan testing validation for fixes

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
/design-review
```

### With Specific Focus
```bash
/design-review
Focus on the dashboard changes I made, particularly the credit display formatting and mobile navigation.
```

### After Major UI Changes
```bash
/design-review  
I just updated the entire roster management interface. Please pay special attention to the 5-hub navigation integration and touch target sizing.
```
