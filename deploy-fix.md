# Critical Production Fix Applied

## Issue
Production site at https://www.realmrivalry.com was showing "Cannot GET /" error.

## Root Cause
The production server (`server/production-simple.ts`) had a critical flaw in initialization logic:
- If authentication setup failed, the server would return early
- This prevented static file serving from being initialized
- Result: No routes were set up, causing "Cannot GET /" error

## Fix Applied
Modified server startup sequence to ensure static file serving is ALWAYS initialized, regardless of authentication setup success/failure.

## Changes Made
- Modified `server/production-simple.ts` to run both `setupAuthenticationSync()` and `initializeStaticServing()` independently
- Server now provides appropriate status messages based on which components succeeded
- Static files will be served even if authentication fails

## Deployment Required
This fix needs to be deployed to production via GitHub Actions pipeline to take effect.

## Expected Result After Deployment
- Site should load properly at https://www.realmrivalry.com
- React app should be served from `/dist/` directory
- Authentication may or may not work depending on environment variables, but site will load
