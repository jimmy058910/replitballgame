# Step 5 Deployment Issue Fix

## Problem Identified
- Step 4 workflow triggers on ANY push to main (no path filter)  
- Step 5 workflow has specific path triggers but isn't in repository yet
- When you commit/push Step 5 files, Step 4 runs instead

## Root Cause
Step 4 workflow configuration:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]  # ← Triggers on ANY push
```

Step 5 workflow configuration:
```yaml  
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:                # ← Only triggers on specific files
      - 'server-realtime-step5.js'
      - 'Dockerfile.step5-websocket'
```

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Manual Trigger (RECOMMENDED)
Once Step 5 workflow is in repository:
1. Commit/push Step 5 files (will trigger Step 4)
2. Go to GitHub Actions
3. Manually run "Deploy Step 5 - Real-Time Game Features"

### Option 2: Temporary Step 4 Modification  
Temporarily add path filters to Step 4 to prevent conflict

### Option 3: Wait for Step 4 to Complete
Let Step 4 run, then manually trigger Step 5

## Immediate Action Plan
1. First push Step 5 workflow file to make it available in GitHub
2. Use manual trigger for Step 5 deployment
3. This avoids workflow conflicts and ensures proper Step 5 deployment

## Commands to Execute
```bash
# Only add the workflow file first
git add .github/workflows/deploy-step5-websocket.yml
git commit -m "Add Step 5 workflow for manual deployment"
git push origin main

# Then manually trigger Step 5 from GitHub Actions interface
```
