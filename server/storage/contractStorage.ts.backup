// Backup of original contractStorage.ts - schema mismatch discovered
// Original file had 24 compilation errors due to database schema incompatibility
// This file expects fields like teamId, isActive, expiryDate, contractType
// But actual Contract schema only has: id, playerId, player, staffId, staff, salary, length, signingBonus, startDate
