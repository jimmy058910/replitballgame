/**
 * SEASONAL FLOW SERVICE - Clean Delegating Structure
 * 
 * This service has been refactored from a 2,297-line monolith into a 
 * clean modular architecture with focused, maintainable components.
 * 
 * Original monolithic structure: 2,297 lines
 * New modular structure: ~50 lines (this file) + 4 specialized services
 * 
 * Modules:
 * - ScheduleGenerationService: Season/division schedule creation
 * - PlayoffService: Playoff brackets and tournament management  
 * - PromotionRelegationService: League promotions, relegations, AI teams
 * - SeasonManagementService: Season rollover, standings, awards
 * 
 * All functionality preserved with improved maintainability.
