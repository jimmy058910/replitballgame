/**
 * MATCH ROUTES - Clean Delegating Structure
 * 
 * This file has been refactored from a 1,347-line monolith into a 
 * clean modular architecture by delegating to existing modular structures.
 * 
 * Original monolithic structure: 1,347 lines
 * New modular structure: ~30 lines (this file) + reusing existing modules
 * 
 * All match functionality preserved through modular delegation.
