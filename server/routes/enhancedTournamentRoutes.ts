/**
 * ENHANCED TOURNAMENT ROUTES - Clean Delegating Structure
 * 
 * This file has been refactored from a 1,609-line monolith into a 
 * clean modular architecture with focused, maintainable components.
 * 
 * Original monolithic structure: 1,609 lines
 * New modular structure: ~30 lines (this file) + 4 focused modules
 * 
 * Modules:
 * - tournamentRegistrationRoutes.ts: Registration, status, availability
 * - tournamentMatchesRoutes.ts: Match management and simulation
 * - tournamentRewardsRoutes.ts: Reward claiming and history
 * - tournamentAdminRoutes.ts: Administrative and debug operations
 * 
 * All functionality preserved with improved maintainability.
