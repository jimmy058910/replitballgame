/**
 * LEAGUE ROUTES - Clean Delegating Structure
 * 
 * This file has been refactored from a 2,717-line monolith into a 
 * clean modular architecture with focused, maintainable components.
 * 
 * Original monolithic structure: 2,717 lines
 * New modular structure: ~30 lines (this file) + 4 focused modules
 * 
 * Modules:
 * - leagueStandingsRoutes.ts: Division standings and rankings
 * - leagueTeamsRoutes.ts: Team management within leagues
 * - leagueScheduleRoutes.ts: Schedule generation and management
 * - leagueAdminRoutes.ts: Administrative and debug operations
 * 
 * All functionality preserved with improved maintainability.
