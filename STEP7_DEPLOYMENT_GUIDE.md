# STEP 7 UNIFIED APPLICATION - DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## Overview
This is the final, comprehensive deployment that combines ALL successful methodologies from Steps 1-6 into a unified production-ready application.

## What's Included in Step 7

### ✅ Complete Technology Stack
- **Express Framework** with comprehensive security middleware (Helmet, CORS, rate limiting)
- **Cloud SQL PostgreSQL** integration with connection pooling
- **Firebase Authentication** with Google OAuth and session management
- **React Frontend** with production build and SPA routing
- **WebSocket Server** for real-time match simulation
- **Enhanced API Routes** with authentic game data
- **Established Game Systems** (8-tier divisions, 5 fantasy races, 6v6 dome mechanics)

### ✅ Production-Ready Features
- Multi-stage Docker build with optimization
- Security hardening and performance tuning
- Comprehensive health monitoring
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Error handling and logging
- Auto-scaling Cloud Run configuration

### ✅ Comprehensive Testing
- Local testing script (`test-step7-unified.js`)
- Health endpoint verification
- API route validation
- WebSocket functionality testing
- Database integration checks
- Authentication system verification

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Verify Local Setup
```bash
# Test the unified application locally
node test-step7-unified.js
```

### 2. Commit and Push Changes
The deployment will trigger automatically when you push these files:
- `server-step7-unified.js` (unified application)
- `Dockerfile.step7-unified` (production build)
- `.github/workflows/deploy-step7-unified.yml` (deployment workflow)

### 3. Monitor Deployment
- GitHub Actions will build and deploy automatically
- Watch the workflow progress in your repository's Actions tab
- Deployment URL will be: `https://realm-rivalry-unified-<project-id>.us-central1.run.app`

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, the system will automatically verify:

### ✅ Core Functionality
- [ ] Health endpoint responding (200 OK)
- [ ] Database integration working
- [ ] Authentication system active
- [ ] Frontend serving correctly
- [ ] WebSocket server enabled

### ✅ Game Systems
- [ ] Divisions API (8-tier system with subdivisions)
- [ ] Players API (5 races, 3 roles)
- [ ] Teams API (authentic league structure)
- [ ] Statistics API (comprehensive game data)

### ✅ Performance
- [ ] Concurrent request handling
- [ ] Response time optimization
- [ ] Memory and CPU efficiency
- [ ] Auto-scaling functionality

## Expected Service Configuration

### Cloud Run Settings
- **Memory**: 4GB
- **CPU**: 2 cores
- **Min Instances**: 1
- **Max Instances**: 10
- **Timeout**: 300 seconds
- **Concurrency**: 200 requests

### Environment Variables
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL` (Cloud SQL connection)
- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_BASE64` (Firebase auth)
- `SESSION_SECRET` (session encryption)

### Security Features
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Rate limiting (1000 requests/15 minutes)
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Helmet.js security headers
- Non-root container execution

## API Endpoints

### Health & Status
- `GET /health` - Application health check
- `GET /healthz` - Kubernetes/Cloud Run probe
- `GET /api/db-test` - Database connectivity
- `GET /api/auth/status` - Authentication status

### Game Data APIs
- `GET /api/divisions` - 8-tier division system
- `GET /api/players` - Player data with races/roles
- `GET /api/teams` - Team management
- `GET /api/stats/overview` - Game statistics

### Real-Time Features
- `WebSocket /ws` - Real-time match simulation
- Match rooms and user management
- Live score updates and game events
- 6v6 dome system with fantasy races

## Architecture Benefits

### ✅ Unified Codebase
- Single application with all features
- Simplified deployment and maintenance
- Consistent logging and monitoring
- Shared authentication and database

### ✅ Production Readiness
- Industry-standard security practices
- Performance optimization
- Error handling and recovery
- Monitoring and health checks

### ✅ Scalability
- Auto-scaling Cloud Run deployment
- Efficient resource utilization
- Connection pooling and caching
- Load balancing capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Deployment Timeout**: Increase build timeout if needed
2. **Database Connection**: Verify Cloud SQL instance and credentials
3. **Authentication Errors**: Check Firebase service account configuration
4. **Frontend 404s**: Ensure SPA routing is configured correctly

### Monitoring
- Use Cloud Run logs for debugging
- Health endpoint provides system status
- API endpoints return detailed error information
- WebSocket connections are logged

## Success Criteria

The deployment is successful when:
- ✅ All health checks pass
- ✅ API endpoints return authentic game data
- ✅ Frontend loads and displays correctly
- ✅ WebSocket real-time features work
- ✅ Database queries execute successfully
- ✅ Authentication flow completes

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Production Testing**: Verify all features work in the deployed environment
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Watch metrics and optimize as needed
3. **User Acceptance**: Test the complete user journey
4. **Documentation**: Update any API documentation
5. **Development**: Resume feature development on the deployed foundation
