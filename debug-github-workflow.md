# GitHub Workflow Visibility Issue Debug

## Problem
- Step 5 workflow file exists locally: `.github/workflows/deploy-step5-websocket.yml`
- File shows in local directory listing
- GitHub Actions interface doesn't show "Deploy Step 5 - Real-Time Game Features"
- Manual run doesn't work

## Possible Causes

### 1. Git Sync Issue
- File may not actually be committed/pushed to GitHub repository
- Local file exists but remote doesn't have it

### 2. Workflow Syntax Error
- YAML syntax error preventing GitHub from recognizing the workflow
- Invalid workflow configuration

### 3. GitHub Actions Cache Issue
- GitHub may need time to detect new workflow files
- Sometimes takes a few minutes to appear

### 4. File Permissions/Encoding
- File encoding issues preventing proper parsing
- Hidden characters or BOM

## Immediate Solutions

### Solution 1: Force Rebuild Workflow File
Create a clean, simple workflow file and commit it directly

### Solution 2: Check Actual GitHub Repository
Verify if the file actually exists in the GitHub repository via web interface

### Solution 3: Alternative Deployment Method
Use existing Step 4 workflow but modify it to deploy Step 5 components

## Recommended Action
Let me create a simplified, guaranteed-working Step 5 workflow file and commit it properly to ensure it appears in GitHub Actions.
