Stadium & Financial Mechanics
This section details the core income and expenses that drive a team's economy.

A. Fan Attendance Algorithm
Attendance for home games is dynamic and crucial for income. It's calculated on a per-game basis.
Formula: Attendance = BaseCapacity * DivisionModifier * FanLoyaltyModifier * WinStreakModifier

Base Capacity: The current seat capacity of your stadium.

Division Modifier: Fans are more interested in higher-level play.
Div 1: 1.2x | Div 2: 1.1x | Div 3: 1.05x | Div 4: 1.0x | Div 5: 0.95x | Div 6: 0.9x | Div 7: 0.85x | Div 8: 0.8x

Fan Loyalty Modifier (0.75x to 1.25x): A persistent stat (0-100%) representing fan happiness. It increases with wins and stadium improvements (Lighting/Screens) and decays with losses or long periods of inactivity.

Win Streak Modifier (1.0x to 1.5x): A temporary boost for exciting play.
3-game streak: 1.1x | 5-game streak: 1.25x | 8+ game streak: 1.5x. Resets on loss.
