Tactics & Lineup Hub UI/UX Revamp
Goal: To completely redesign the /team/tactics page into a single, intuitive command center for all strategic and lineup decisions. This new design replaces the confusing multi-tab layout with a functional, two-panel interface that allows users to set their starters, substitutes, and overall game plan.

1. Core Design Philosophy
Function Over Form: The primary goal is to give the user functional control over their team. The ability to set a lineup is paramount.

Consolidation: The four existing sub-tabs (Tactical Setup, Effects Analysis, Effectiveness, Match Impact) are REMOVED. Their essential information is integrated into a new, cleaner two-panel layout.

Visual & Interactive: Setting a lineup should be a visual, drag-and-drop experience, making it easy and engaging.

2. Proposed Two-Panel Layout
The new Tactics Hub will be a single page divided into two main sections:

Lineup & Formation: A visual, interactive panel for setting starters and subs.

Strategy & Focus: A panel for setting high-level team tactics and seeing their projected effectiveness.

3. Detailed Component Breakdown
A. Lineup & Formation Panel (The Roster Board)
This is the most critical new component. It's an interactive board for managing your active roster for the next match.

Visual Layout:

On the left side, a list of all healthy and available players on your team roster. Each player is shown as a small, draggable card with their Name, Role Icon, and Power rating.

On the right side, a visual representation of the field with 6 "Starter" slots and several "Substitute" slots below them.

Functionality:

Drag & Drop: Users can drag a player card from the roster list on the left and drop them into one of the 6 "Starter" slots or the "Substitute" slots.

Role Highlighting: The starter slots could be labeled by role (e.g., 2 Blocker slots, 2 Runner slots, 2 Passer slots). When the user drags a "Runner" card, the available "Runner" slots on the field could light up, guiding them to place players in their natural positions.

Saving the Lineup: A clear "Save Lineup" button must be present. This lineup will be used for the next simulated game.

B. Strategy & Focus Panel
This panel consolidates the high-level tactical choices from the old design.

1. Tactical Setup:

Field Size Specialization: This module remains. It allows the user to make their once-per-season choice of "Standard," "Large," or "Small" home field. It should be locked during the season as it is now.

Team-Wide Tactical Focus: This module also remains. The user can select "Balanced," "All-Out Attack," or "Defensive Wall" before each match.

2. Effectiveness Analysis (NEW Integrated Section):

This section replaces the old Effectiveness tab and provides real-time feedback on the user's choices.

Overall Effectiveness Score: A large percentage score that gives an overall rating of how well the user's current lineup and tactics synergize.

Breakdown: Below the main score, a breakdown shows how it's calculated:

Roster Suitability: How well do the chosen starters fit the selected Tactical Focus? (e.g., having fast Runners for an "All-Out Attack" gives a high score).

Coach Influence: How much is your Head Coach's Tactics stat boosting your chosen strategy?

Field Advantage Fit: How well does your roster suit your chosen Field Size?

3. Optimization Recommendations:

This is a simple text box that provides dynamic advice based on the Effectiveness Analysis.

Examples:

"Your 'All-Out Attack' tactic would be more effective with faster Runners in the starting lineup."

"Your Head Coach's low Tactics rating is limiting the effectiveness of your chosen strategy."

"Your tactical setup is well-optimized for your current roster!"

4. Integration with Game Mechanics & Commentary
Lineup: The saved lineup must be used by the match simulation engine to determine the starters for the next game.

Tactics: The selected Tactical Focus and Field Size must be passed to the simulation to apply their respective in-game effects on AI behavior and player stats.

Commentary: The commentary engine should reference the chosen tactic. For example: "[PRE-GAME] Team A is coming out with their 'All-Out Attack' strategy today, looking to overwhelm the opposition early."

This revamped design transforms the Tactics page from a confusing, static information display into the true strategic heart of the game, giving users the control they need to feel like a real manager.
