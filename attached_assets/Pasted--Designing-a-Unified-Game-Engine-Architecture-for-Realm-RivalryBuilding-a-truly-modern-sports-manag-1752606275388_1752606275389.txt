# Designing a Unified Game Engine Architecture for Realm RivalryBuilding a truly modern sports-management title on the web demands more than adding features piecemeal. Realm Rivalry needs a cohesive, data-driven engine that treats every system—attributes, tactics, stadium ops, coaching, camaraderie, stamina, injuries, substitutions—as interlocking layers fed by a single state store. Below is a full technical blueprint for moving from today’s socket-based match loop to a scalable, maintainable architecture that unifies simulation and rendering while remaining React- and Node-friendly.

## 1. Architectural Overview### 1.1 Core Principles  
* **Entity-Component-System (ECS) backbone** – separates data (components) from logic (systems).  
* **Layered temporal ticks** – instant (per animation frame), play (seconds), phase (minutes), fixture (90 min), macro (week/season).  
* **Single source of truth** – Redux Toolkit Query or Zustand store mirrored on server via WebSocket channels.  
* **Event bus** – Pub/Sub pattern to decouple systems (injury events, morale shifts, finance updates).  
* **Functional-pure simulation** – deterministic when seeded; reproducible tests.  

### 1.2 Module Layout| Module | Main Responsibilities | Tech Notes |
| ------ | -------------------- | ---------- |
| `core/ecs` | Component schemas, world registry, system scheduler | TypeScript, `bitecs` for SoA memory |
| `simulation/match` | Possession logic, stamina decay, injury checks, substitution AI | Runs headless on Node or client worker |
| `simulation/meta` | Training, staff effects, stadium ROI, morale evolution | Cron-style ticks |
| `state` | Global store, event emitter, optimistic caching | Zustand with Immer |
| `render/ui` | React components, scoreboard, 2.5D pitch | PixiJS or Three.js renderer system |
| `analytics` | Telemetry, A/B hooks, AI tuning | PostHog + ClickHouse |
| `testing` | Scenario snapshots, golden-master replay | Jest, Jest-Circus, fast-check |

## 2. Detailed System Designs  

### 2.1 Attributes & Skill Progression  
* Components: `Physical {speed, power}`, `Technical {shoot, pass}`, `Mental {vision, leadership}`.  
* Logistic growth curve with training delta α and fatigue penalty β each weekly tick[1].  
* Staff quality acts as multiplier; coaching-efficacy research shows β ↓ when coach-athlete agreement is high[2].  

### 2.2 Stamina & Fatigue  
* Real-time decay governed by expenditure table (sprint, jog, stand).  
* Recovery system triggered at half-time and post-match (glycogen restore model)[3].  
* Exposed selector `selectStaminaPct(id)` for UI bars.

### 2.3 Injury Risk Engine  
* Multimodal XGBoost model using workload, previous injuries, musculoskeletal risk markers[4][5][6].  
* System runs each play tick; emits `InjuryEvent{type, severity, downtime}`.  

### 2.4 Camaraderie & Morale  
* Weighted graph of pair synergies (chemistry matrix) updated by shared minutes and off-field events[7][8].  
* Team morale scalar modifies attribute rolls (+/-5%) and ticket demand elasticity via “fan buzz”.

### 2.5 Coaching & Tactical AI  
* Coach entity with `TacticPreference` and `SubstitutionPolicy` components.  
* Decision trees (Optimal Prescriptive Tree)[9] choose substitution cluster given game state (score, minute, stamina).  
* Reinforcement learning layer (TacticAI-style GNN)[10][11] suggests corner routines; coaches may accept/reject.  

### 2.6 Stadium Economics  
* Stadium entity: `Capacity`, `Amenities`, `Safety`, `PitchQuality`.  
* Revenue = seats × price × utilization elasticity (−0.6 avg MLB, −0.44 NBA, −0.23 NFL)[12][13].  
* Upgrade ROI simulation uses Monte Carlo over attendance scenarios.  

A graphical snapshot of real-world revenue dependence underscores why stadium systems deserve first-class status:### 2.7 Match Loop Flow1. Play tick receives `ActionIntent` (pass, shoot, tackle).  
2. Systems compute resolution; update components.  
3. Event bus dispatches changes (goal, foul, fatigue spike).  
4. Renderer listens for diff patches and animates.  

## 3. Technology Stack Recommendations| Concern | Tool | Reason |
| ------- | ---- | ------ |
| **ECS library** | `bitecs` | Cache-friendly, TS typings, web-worker safe |
| **Data validation** | `zod` | Shared schemas client/server |
| **Real-time channels** | Socket.IO + Redis adapter | Horizontal scaling |
| **Simulation threads** | Comlink workers | Offload heavy math from UI |
| **Persistence** | MongoDB + Realm Sync | JSON docs map cleanly to component blobs |
| **Testing** | `jest + fast-check` | Property-based fuzzing for match outcomes |

## 4. Implementation Roadmap  

| Sprint | Deliverable |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 1–2 | Scaffold ECS, port existing player schema to components, replicate current match results for parity tests. |
| 3–4 | Integrate stamina & fatigue; visual stamina bars; unit tests deterministic. |
| 5–6 | Add injury risk engine; weekly meta tick; staff multipliers. |
| 7–8 | Chemistry graph + morale feedback into match-day skill rolls. |
| 9–10 | Tactical AI module: substitution decision tree, corner-kick recommender. |
| 11–12 | Stadium economy layer; ticket price elasticity model; upgrade UI panel. |
| 13 | Load testing, Redis pub/sub, docs via Storybook. |

## 5. Key Payoffs  

* **Modularity** – new mechanics (VAR, weather) plug in as systems, not rewrites.  
* **Performance** – SoA ECS yields 10× less GC churn than OOP entities in Node benchmarks.  
* **Balance & Analytics** – deterministic seeds enable A/B of stamina coefficients; telemetry closes loop.  
* **Player Experience** – richer morale arcs, realistic injuries, emergent tactics elevating long-term engagement.  

## 6. Final Recommendations1. Adopt the ECS skeleton immediately; migrate features gradually behind toggles.  
2. Keep simulation logic headless and pure; UI subscribes via store diff.  
3. Use data-backed models (injury XGBoost, chemistry graphs) from day one; they can start naïve and learn over beta.  
4. Treat stadium operations as a revenue gameplay pillar, not decoration.  
5. Maintain rigorous automated tests with golden-master season replays to catch regressions.  

By following this blueprint, Realm Rivalry will evolve from a set of isolated scripts into a cohesive, future-proof sports-simulation platform capable of supporting every planned mechanic—and the ones you have yet to imagine.
