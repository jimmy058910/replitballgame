Unified Contract & Salary System
Goal: To design a robust, fair, and scalable system for generating and negotiating player and staff contracts. This system ensures that compensation is directly tied to an individual's value (based on attributes, age, and potential) and resolves existing imbalances between player and staff salaries.
1. Core Philosophy
Unified Value: Both players and staff will have their base salary determined by a single, universal formula. This ensures their costs are always appropriately scaled relative to each other and the game's economy.
[cite_start]Rookie & Entry-Level Talent: New teams will start by signing young, low-rated (but potentially high-potential) players and staff, making their initial salaries affordable. [cite: 4] This addresses the issue of new entities being too powerful and expensive.
Dynamic Negotiation: Negotiations will be a strategic challenge based on multiple factors, not a simple mathematical certainty.
2. The Universal Value Formula (UVF)
This formula is the new foundation for all salary calculations. It produces a Base Salary Expectation for any individual (player or staff).
Base Salary = (AttributeValue + PotentialValue) * AgeModifier
AttributeValue: The core of a player's current worth.
Sum of all 8 Player Attributes * 50 ₡
Sum of all Staff Attributes * 150 ₡ (Staff attributes are rarer and have a wider impact, justifying a higher multiplier).
PotentialValue: High-potential individuals demand more, as they represent a better long-term investment.
Player's 10-point Potential Rating * 1000 ₡
AgeModifier: A multiplier that reflects a player/staff member's career stage.
Youth (16-23): x 0.8 (Talented but unproven, cheaper).
Prime (24-30): x 1.2 (At the peak of their value).
Veteran (31-34): x 1.0 (Still valuable, but past their peak).
Declining (35+): x 0.7 (Higher risk, lower demand).
This formula directly solves the issue of disproportionate staff salaries. A new Level 1 staff member with low attributes will now have a much lower, more appropriate starting salary compared to a veteran star player.
3. Revamped Contract Negotiation Logic
The negotiation process will use the new Base Salary Expectation as its foundation.
A. Market Value Calculation:
[cite_start]The concept of player.salary * 1.1 is replaced. [cite: 7] The new Market Value is the player's Base Salary Expectation calculated from the UVF above.
B. Offer Quality & Player Response:
[cite_start]The offerQualityValue calculation and the influence of camaraderieAdjustment are excellent and will be kept. [cite: 8, 9] [cite_start]The system will still use the same response categories (Happy, Considering, Demanding, Rejecting). [cite: 11, 12, 13, 14]
[cite_start]Fixing the 20,000 Minimum Bug: The minimum allowable offer should not be a hardcoded number. [cite: 6]
New Rule: The minimum offer a user can make is 70% of the player's calculated MarketValue.
C. Counter-Offer Formula:
The existing counter-offer formula is good, but it should be based on the new MarketValue.
Revised Formula:
counterOfferSalary = MarketValue * (1.05 + randf_range(0.0, 0.1)) (A counter will always be for slightly more than their market value).
counterOfferBonus = counterOfferSalary * randf_range(0.1, 0.2) (A signing bonus of 10-20% of the first year's salary).
4. Staff-Specific Contract Rules
[cite_start]Simpler Negotiation: Staff contract negotiations are more straightforward than player negotiations. [cite: 2]
They use the same Universal Value Formula to determine their MarketValue.
However, they are not influenced by Team Camaraderie. Their acceptance threshold is more static (e.g., they will generally accept offers >= 95% of their market value).
Staff are less likely to make counter-offers; they will more often simply accept or reject.
This unified system creates a much more balanced and logical financial ecosystem. It ensures that all salaries are derived from a single source of truth (the UVF), fixes the salary imbalances, addresses the starting power level of new players and staff, and provides a clear and fair negotiation process.
