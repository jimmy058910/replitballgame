Exhibition Game Mode Revamp (v3)
Goal: To refine and clearly define the purpose, mechanics, and rewards for the Exhibition Game mode. This system is designed to be a low-risk, moderately-rewarding gameplay loop that encourages tactical testing and rewards active players without devaluing competitive modes.
1. Core Philosophy & Mechanics (Revised)
Exhibition games are the team's "scrimmage" or "practice" mode. They are for risk-free experimentation with small, tangible rewards.
Risk-Free Gameplay: This is the most important principle.
No Lasting Injuries: No injuries from an exhibition match will ever carry over to a player's permanent record.
No daily_stamina_level Cost: Playing an exhibition match does not deplete a player's persistent daily_stamina_level. Players always start with 100% in_game_stamina.
No Direct Progression: This mode does not contribute to the end-of-season stat progression checks. The ActivityScore in the player_progression_master_v2 document is explicitly calculated from League and Tournament games only, preserving their importance.
2. Revamped "Exhibition Benefits & Rewards"
The benefits list must be updated to accurately reflect the mode's purpose within the new progression system.
Test Tactics & Lineups: Safely experiment with new strategies before important matches.
Earn Credits: Gain a small but consistent amount of Credits for playing.
Build Team Camaraderie: Winning exhibition games provides a small boost to team morale.
Contribute to Ad Rewards: Watching the halftime ad counts towards your daily and milestone ad rewards.
Risk-Free: No impact on player stamina, injury status, or league standings.
3. Detailed Rewards Structure
A. Credit Rewards (Unchanged) The rewards remain modest to keep the focus on competitive play for primary income.
Win: 500 Credits
Tie: 200 Credits
Loss: 100 Credits
B. Team Camaraderie Reward (Unchanged)
Logic: Upon winning an exhibition match, each player on the winning team gains a small, temporary boost to their individual camaraderie score. This boost is factored in during the end-of-season camaraderie calculation.
Effect: This provides a way for active users to slightly offset the natural seasonal decay of camaraderie, making their daily play feel impactful.
C. Halftime Ad Integration (Unchanged)
Logic: The ad shown at halftime of an exhibition game must count towards the user's daily ad watch limit and their Premium Box milestone counter.
4. UI & UX Enhancements for the Exhibition Page
The previously suggested UI enhancements remain critical for clarity.
A. Revise the "Exhibition Benefits & Rewards" Text:
The list must be updated with the new bullet points from Section 2 of this document.
B. Clarify Daily Game Count Display:
Replace the confusing progress bars with simple text counters:
Free Games Remaining Today: 3
Entry Items Available: 3
C. Add Tooltips to "Exhibition Options":
Add (?) icons with tooltips explaining the difference between "Instant Exhibition" and "Choose Opponent."
D. Update "Recent Exhibition Games" Display:
Replace "PENDING" with the final score and result, e.g., vs. Stone Lions - Win (3 - 1).
This revamped design ensures that the Exhibition Mode has a clear and valuable purpose within your game's ecosystem, rewarding activity without interfering with the core progression loop driven by competitive matches.
