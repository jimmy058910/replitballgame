Tournament Center UI & UX Revamp
Goal: To redesign the /competition > Tournaments tab, consolidating the confusing multi-tab layout into a single, intuitive, and functional hub. This new design is inspired by the successful layout of the Exhibitions page and provides clear, at-a-glance information for all tournament-related activities.

1. Core Design Philosophy
Single-Page Hub: All tournament informationâ€”available events, entry, and historyâ€”will be presented on one scrollable page. The five sub-tabs (Overview, Available, My Tournaments, History, Statistics) are REMOVED.

Clear Separation of Events: The two distinct tournament types, the "Mid-Season Classic" and the "Daily Divisional Cup," will be presented in their own dedicated, card-style sections.

Dynamic & Contextual Content: The information displayed will change dynamically based on the current day of the season, ensuring the page is always relevant to the user.

2. Proposed Tournament Center Layout
The new single-page layout will be organized into three distinct sections, similar to your Exhibitions page:

The Mid-Season Classic Panel (High-Priority Event)

Daily Divisional Cup Panel (Daily Activity)

Tournament History (Recent Results)

3. Detailed Component Breakdown
A. The Mid-Season Classic Panel
This panel is for the special, once-per-season event. Its content changes based on the season day.

During most of the season (Days 1-5 & 8-17): The panel acts as an informational banner.

Title: The Mid-Season Classic

Description: "The premier tournament of the season. Compete against the best in your division for a massive prize and a permanent trophy."

Countdown: A large timer displaying Registration Opens In: [X] Days, HH:MM:SS.

Prize Preview: A small section showing the top prize for the user's division (e.g., "Div 8 Prize: 15,000 â‚¡, 5 ðŸ’Ž, Trophy").

On Registration Day (Day 6): The panel becomes active and actionable.

Title: Mid-Season Classic: Registration OPEN!

Countdown: The timer now shows Registration Closes In: [HH:MM:SS].

Action Button: A prominent button appears: [ Enter Tournament (10,000 â‚¡ / 20 ðŸ’Ž) ]. This button is disabled if the user cannot afford the fee.

On Tournament Day (Day 7): The panel transforms into a live bracket view.

Title: Mid-Season Classic: In Progress

UI: A visual 16-team tournament bracket is displayed, showing all matchups. As games complete, the bracket updates in real-time, showing who advances.

B. Daily Divisional Cup Panel
This panel handles the daily tournament and should mirror the style of your "Exhibition Options" card.

Title: The title should be dynamic based on the user's division, e.g., Stone Division Daily Cup.

Description: "Test your team in a daily, low-risk tournament for a chance to win Credits and Gems."

Information Section:

Entry Fee: Requires: 1x Tournament Entry Item

Top Prize: Champion's Reward: 1,500 â‚¡ (value updates based on division).

Registration Deadline: Registration Closes In: [HH:MM:SS]

Action Button:

A clear [ Enter Daily Cup ] button.

If the user has already entered for the day, the button should be disabled and read [ Entered ].

C. Tournament History Section
This section replaces the old History tab and provides a clean record of past participation.

Title: Recent Tournament Results

UI: A scrollable list of the user's past tournament entries.

Content per Entry: Each entry should clearly show:

The name of the tournament (e.g., "Mid-Season Classic (Season 2)", "Daily Divisional Cup").

The date the tournament was played.

The user's final result (e.g., Champion, Runner-Up, Eliminated in Semifinals).

This consolidated design makes the Tournament Center much easier to understand and use, providing all necessary information on a single, dynamic page that respects the user's time and attention.
