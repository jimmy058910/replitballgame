Commentary System & Stat Integration (Refined)
1. Executive Summary & Core Findings
Your analysis is spot-on. The system's foundation is strong, but the removal of the "turnover" stat creates a mechanical and narrative void that needs to be filled. The current "Loose Ball" commentary still references fumbles and recoveries in a way that implies a traditional turnover, which we need to address.

Furthermore, balancing the frequency of specific commentary types and expanding on the "anything goes" nature of the game will elevate the experience from great to exceptional.

This document proposes the following key refinements:

Introducing the "Contested Ball" System: A new core mechanic and stat category to replace "turnovers," which better reflects the non-stop, chaotic nature of the game.

Streamlining Commentary Categories: Reorganizing the commentary groups for better logical flow and easier implementation.

Balancing & Frequency Tuning: Providing concrete suggestions for trigger rates.

Expanding "Anything Goes" Commentary: Adding new prompts that lean into the brutal, no-rules identity of Realm Rivalry.

2. The "Contested Ball" System (Replaces Turnovers)
Since there are no hard stoppages, a "turnover" is the wrong concept. Instead, a loose ball initiates a "Contest," a chaotic, real-time scramble where possession is up for grabs.

A. New Core Stats
Forced Contests (Player Stat): Replaces "Forced Fumbles." Awarded to a defender who dislodges the ball.

Ball Security Error (Player Stat): Replaces "Fumbles Lost." Given to a player who drops the ball or has it knocked loose.

Contest Recoveries (Player Stat): Replaces "Fumble Recoveries." Awarded to the player who secures the loose ball, regardless of their team.

B. Revised Commentary & Stat Attribution
The "Loose Ball" category should be restructured to reflect this new system.

Category: Ball Dislodged (Forced Contest)

Event Type: forced_contest

Stat Changes: +1 Forced Contest for tackler, +1 Ball Security Error for carrier.

Prompt Example: "HUGE HIT by {tacklerName}! The ball is dislodged! It's a live ball, a contest is on!"

Category: Ball Dropped (Unforced Error)

Event Type: unforced_error

Stat Changes: +1 Drop for receiver, +1 Ball Security Error for receiver.

Prompt Example: "Right through his hands! {receiverName} can't hang on, and the ball is live on the turf!"

Category: Contest Recovery

Event Type: contest_recovery

Stat Changes: +1 Contest Recovery for the recovering player.

Prompt Example: "{playerName} emerges from the chaos with the ball! Possession secured!"

Dynamic Follow-Up: The commentary should then dynamically state if possession was retained or lost. Ex: "...and the offense is lucky to keep the ball!" or "...and the defense has ripped possession away! A massive momentum swing!"

3. Streamlined Commentary Categories & Expansions
Your current list is excellent but can be slightly reorganized for clarity and expanded to lean into the game's identity.

A. Suggested New Structure
Game State & Flow: (Pre-Game, Mid-Game, Urgency, Halftime, Kickoff) - No changes needed.

Offensive Actions:

Run Plays: (Standard, Breakaway, Skill-Based, Race-Based)

Pass Plays: (Standard, Deep, Skill-Based, Race-Based)

Defensive Actions:

Tackles & Blocks: (Standard Tackles, High Power Tackles, Pancake Blocks)

Pass Defense: (Pass Breakups, Interceptions)

Contested Ball Events: (Forced Contest, Unforced Error, Contest Recovery) - As defined above.

Consequences & Attrition:

Injuries & Fatigue: (Injury, Fatigue)

Brutality & "Anything Goes" (New Category): This is where you lean into the no-rules aspect.

Stat Changes: +1 Intimidation Play

Prompt Examples:

"A vicious block by {blockerName} completely away from the ball! It's perfectly legal here in the dome, and it sends a clear message."

"The defense is still hitting {playerName} well after the score! No love lost between these teams."

"He doesn't just tackle him, he drives him into the energy barrier! A brutal but effective play."

Team & Atmosphere: (Atmosphere, Camaraderie, Scoring) - No changes needed.

B. Balancing & Frequency Recommendations
You correctly identified that some trigger rates might be off.

Race-Based Commentary: Lower the trigger rate from 30% to 15%. This will make these moments feel more special and less repetitive.

Skill-Based Commentary: Keep this high. When a player uses a skill, the commentary should reflect it. The issue is likely ensuring the stat counter increments correctly, which is a development priority.

"Brutality" Commentary: Set this to a low trigger rate, perhaps 10% on any High Power Tackle or Pancake Block, to emphasize these moments of extreme violence without overdoing it.

4. Refined Prompt Examples
Here are a few examples of how existing prompts can be refined for more impact, reflecting the new systems.

Old Run Prompt: "{runnerName} grinds it out for {yards} tough yards up the middle."

Refined Run Prompt: "A true war in the trenches! {runnerName} lowers his head and smashes forward, dragging defenders for {yards} brutal yards!"

Old Tackle Prompt: "A thunderous tackle by {defenderName}! You could hear that one from up here."

Refined Tackle Prompt (Forced Contest): "DEVASTATING HIT from {defenderName}! He meets the runner with incredible force and the ball is JARRED LOOSE! It's a live ball, a contest is on!"

Old Scoring Prompt: "He's in! {playerName} fights through the defense and crosses the line! A Score for {teamName}!"

Refined Scoring Prompt (Gryll-Specific): "The earth shakes as the Gryll cannot be denied! {playerName} is an avalanche at the goal line, powering through three defenders for the score! Unstoppable!"

By adopting these refinements, you create a commentary system that is not only statistically robust but also perfectly aligned with the unique, brutal, and non-stop identity of Realm Rivalry.
