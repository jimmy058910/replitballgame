Summary:

Fantasy sports game with multiple races, that is season based with divisions. The game most resembles non-stop American football, rugby, and an old browser based game called Monsterbowl. Basically to get the objective to the other side of the field in the scoring zone. Field is to be contained so it never goes out of bounds. Strategies of throwing, catching, speed, screens, power, and so much more can go into it. The name of the “game” is to be determined, but feel is vital to the success of the game. The game will be 6 vs 6 on the field, with 4 bench players.
Trying to find another name for “Goal” or “Score” or “Touchdown” that would be catchy

Story:

The story is still to be determined, but something along the lines of way back when, the different races clashed and competed against each other (for a reason to be determined). It became more friendly and competitive over the many years, to the point where the races mixed teams to become the absolute best and the goal was to win at the highest level/division.

Races:
Humans: No description needed, Earth beings
The Sylvans: Instead of typical elves, these beings are deeply connected to nature, with skin resembling bark and hair like leaves. Their society is built on the wisdom of nature, and their magic stems from their connection to nature.
The Gryll: Replacing orcs, the Gryll are subterranean dwellers, with tough, rocky skin and a culture centered around mining, hard-work, and craftsmanship. They are known for their resilience and skill.
The Lumina: The Lumina are beings of pure light, capable of manipulating energy and healing light wounds. Their cities are radiant beacons of hope, and they are seen as guardians of knowledge and enlightenment.
The Umbra: Masters of deception, stealth, and misdirection. Slimmer creatures that are used to residing in mostly darkness


The Sylvans (Revised):
Focus: Enhanced Agility & Awareness
Traits:
Nimble: Increased dodge chance.
Keen Senses: Slightly increased interception range, or higher awareness.
Rationale: These traits represent their natural connection to the environment, making them more aware and agile than average.

The Gryll (Revised):
Focus: Resilience and Physical Strength
Traits:
Sturdy: Reduced chance of injury.
Powerful Build: Increased blocking effectiveness.
Rationale: These traits reflect their hard-working, subterranean nature, making them tough and strong.

The Lumina (Revised):
Focus: Precision and Energy Management
Traits:
Precise Throwing: Increased throwing accuracy.
Efficient Stamina: Reduced stamina drain when throwing.
Rationale: Represents their control over energy, translating into efficiency and precision.

The Umbra (Revised):
Focus: Deception and Strategic Positioning
Traits:
Evasive: Slightly increased movement speed when not in possession of the ball.
Distracting Presence: Slightly reduces the Throwing/Catching accuracy of nearby opponents.
Rationale: Emphasizes their shadowy nature through strategic advantages rather than teleportation or smoke fields.

Usage:

This will be used and designed for mobile (Android and iPhone), as well as Desktop/Laptop browser. Will be using Godot, with Visual Studio Code, and Firebase for the backend for development.

Game Mechanics:

Player Management:
When signing up, start with a team of 10 players.
Basic training for the aforementioned attributes, and a leveling system to help with progression. 
Players will also have an “age system”. Start somewhere around 18 years old, and be done as a max at about 45 years old. Many different factors go into the longevity of a player. From race, to usage history, to keeping up on stamina, etc.
The (8) attributes are: Speed, Power, Throwing, Catching, Kicking, Stamina, Leadership, and Agility.
Players have inventory slots. Inventory items are permanent when assigned, but can be replaced. Helmet, chest, shoes, and gloves. Items can be attained several ways.

Player profiles:
Of the 8 aforementioned attributes, they can range between 1-40 (1 worst, 40 best). Depending on scout levels etc, this can be a range of numbers, such as 2-12, indicating the player isn’t great at that attribute. Additionally, there should be a separate “potential” based on a 5 star system, and can include half stars. For example, a 20 year old can have 20-23 current speed attribute, but has 5 full stars for speed potential, indicating he may progress to near 40 in this attribute.

Credit/Currency Management:
Players will have salaries, and have to negotiate re-signing. Players that decline will move to the marketplace at the end of the season.
Players will know their worth and potential to an extent, and will want to negotiate a higher salary if possible. If teams have been together long and have a lot of camaraderie, I’d like that to be a factor in negotiations and maybe “cut a deal” to the team to stay together.
I want the management of funds to be important to teams.

Tactics:
Can have up to 3 different tactics for your team. This can have different player placements, player instructions, etc. Want to keep it fairly simple, so it’s not TOO complex.

Staff Management:
A recovery and injury prevention person (2-stats)
3 trainers, with a primary focus for each (offense, defense, and physical)
Head Scout (2-stats, potential and current) - The better the scout, the more intel and accuracy of player ratings
Recruiting Scout (teams up with head scout and can help draw better talent to tryout)
Head Coach - Helps accelerate xp earned, camaraderie/teamwork, and in-game momentum

Leagues & Games:

League Format - Depending on division and algorithm, somewhere between 6 and 10 teams in a league/division. The goal is to get seasons in fairly quickly, where they last about 14 game days. For example, a league of 8 teams would have each team play each other twice, home & away. The algorithm would promote and demote teams. Division 1 thru 8 sounds good, and they can have special division names (like Diamond, Ruby, etc, or a different naming style.)
Daily, the user can play 3 exhibition type games for added experience, training, and tactic fine tuning. There’s a very low risk of injury and minimal stamina depletion.
Save game code to be able to re-watch game states. Can download, but delete on the server after 2 seasons.
End of season prizes for division standings (top 3)
	
	Tournaments:
	Tournament entry fee of credits, limit one per day, 8 teams, matchmaking style, within your division (1-8). Prizes awarded to top 2 teams (credits and items)

	Inventory Management & Currency:
	Tab for equipment. Capped limit, can purchase more slots
	Tab for items (tournament entry pass, extra exhibition games, stamina recovery, injury recovery, and other ideas)
	Credits count

	Recruiting:
	Once per season (or offseason - window of 1-2 days between leagues) can pay to host a tryout for recruiting more players. There’s a basic level, very small credit fee, and there’s a more advanced and expensive effort. The basic will give you 3 players, which you can choose to keep for on your “Taxi” slots and promote for next season, or get rid of. The advanced will cost much more, and give you 5 players, which you can choose to keep for on your “Taxi” slots and promote for next season, or get rid of.

	Game duration:
	In-game, two 10-minute halves
	Real life duration, each halve is roughly 3 minutes, with an ad shown for revenue, and quick key stats shown for team vs team.
	Exhibition games only one half
	Players can become injured in game, and require a substitution after the next score.

	Stats:
	Team and player stats can be: Scores, passes completed, steals, time of possession, etc.

	Post Game:
	Award an MVP to the winning team of the game

	Awards:
	End of season awards for each division. Remains on the player profile and can help with marketplace sales etc.

	Abilities:
	Each player can have a maximum of 3 abilities. These can be given right away when the player enters the game world, luck through training and/or leveling up, etc. These skills can be 3-different tiers (basic, advanced, Godly). Can lose skills as players age or get injured. Depending on the type of player, the skills will be more likely to be given to them.
	
	Team Inactivity:
	If after a team is completely inactive with no actions past logging in, the entire team and players will be deleted entirely after 4 in-game seasons.
	If a team has paid real money, this is extended to 8 in-game seasons of completely inactive with no actions past logging in.

	Marketplace:
	A system to buy or sell players. Each team can list 3 at the most. Teams cannot have less than 10 players, and can have no more than 13.
	A fair buy-it-now price (minimum), as well as a duration based bidding system.
	Small fee for deleting a player.
	Small percentage based fee for selling a player.
	Small fee for listing a player.

	Store:
	The goal of the game is to obviously make money, for profit, pay upkeep, advertise and outreach, hire a team, etc. At the same time, I don’t want it to be the highest level of pay to win.
	Each day, there should be a rotating 6-8 store items available for purchase for either currency or credits.
	Can watch ads for extra rewards such as credits, or more basic items, or maybe even a mystery box.
	After 100 ads watched, get a premium mystery box.

	Stadium/Facility Management:
	Can pay for more seats (momentum/hype would determine fans and ticket prices)
	Can choose from (3) different field sizes to help fit your tactics (small, medium, large)
	Sponsor involvement?

	Notifications:
	Would like to push notification an hour before the next league game is played.
	Push notification on store reset
	Push notification once the tournament starts.
	Push notification for being outbid (only one notification, not every single time the players initial bid is outbid)
	Option to choose notifications and methods (email, push, etc).

UI:
Need all ideation samples to come up with a great UI

Social Integration:
Integrate for Discord
Integrate for Facebook Page
Integrate for Instagram
Integrate for TikTok
Place to input redemption codes

	I want to require authentication with either a Google, Facebook, or Apple account. This would safeguard against teams creating players rapidly in hopes to sell to their other account.



Expanding on Stats:

Throwing: This seems essential for making the passing game meaningful. Right now, pass_speed is a constant in ball.gd.
Potential Use: We could make pass_speed and maybe even the max_pass_range calculated based on the passer's Throwing attribute. Higher Throwing = faster, potentially longer passes. We could also introduce pass accuracy here – a higher Throwing stat could mean the ball lands closer to the intended target_destination, while lower Throwing adds more random deviation.
My thoughts: Pass speed, pass distance, accuracy, and finding the open player all seem like great almost sub attributes for the parent Throwing.
Catching: This is the other side of passing. Currently, any player whose PickupArea overlaps the ball after the pass_reception_timer ends can grab it if conditions are met.
Potential Use: We could add a "catch check" when the ball arrives near the intended receiver (or any player trying to intercept). A player's Catching attribute could determine the probability of successfully securing the ball vs. having it bounce off or be fumbled, especially if they are moving or under pressure.
My thoughts: I like the idea of a catch check for when the ball is in proximity of 2 or more players, where the player gets possession whoever wins. I also think catching can be used for both offense and defense (interceptions). 
Kicking: You mentioned this for secondary scoring and potentially clearing.
Potential Use: Similar to Throwing, Kicking stat would influence kick distance, speed, and accuracy. Requires implementing a separate "kick" action distinct from passing.
My thoughts: Kicking would be similar to throwing, but would be less accurate, more power, and potentially used more to “flip the field” (kick from own end, to get it far down the field and away from scoring zone)
Leadership: This is more of a "soft" attribute, fitting well with the management sim aspect.
Potential Use: Could provide a small boost to nearby teammates' performance (maybe slightly less stamina drain, slightly better chance in contests?), influence AI decisions (players might be more likely to pass to a leader), or factor into simulated team morale/cohesion effects. Less critical for immediate mechanics but important for team building flavour.
My thoughts: I want to add a team sort of camaraderie factor (more games or seasons together, perform better together), where leadership helps that accelerate quicker, but also have a factor in game for maybe slightly smarter decisions or something along those lines. Leadership can also help with teammate training progression (albeit minimally)
Agility:
Expanding on agility. Getting out of a tackle is great, but also the ability to evade a tackle entirely would be a great addition I believe.
Stamina:
This should affect overall performance, not strictly speed
Power:
Power should have multiple uses, or maybe sub-attribute features like throwing. Power should make blocking more effective, or pushing back opponents, or knocking down ball carriers effectively and potentially quicker, etc.
Necessity & Next Steps:
Throwing and Catching feel like the most important next attributes to integrate, as they directly enhance the passing mechanic we just implemented. Making passes stat-dependent adds crucial depth.
Kicking can be added when you want to implement those specific mechanics (clearing/secondary score).
Leadership can be layered on later to influence AI and team dynamics.
