UI System Design: The Community Hub
Goal: To provide a central location for all social features, player support, and external game-related information. This hub is designed to foster player interaction and provide necessary resources.
1. Top-Level Tabs
The Community Hub consolidates social and support features into a few clear sections:
Social
Referrals
Redeem Code
Game Guide
2. Tab Content Breakdown
A. Social Tab
Purpose: To connect the game to its wider community on external platforms.
UI: A simple and visually appealing page with large, clear icons and links.
Key Components:
Social Platform Links: A series of buttons with official logos (e.g., Discord, Twitter/X, Reddit, Facebook, YouTube) that link directly to the game's official community pages.
Share Content Section:
"Share Your Team" Button: When clicked, this generates a pre-formatted text block or an image that the user can easily copy to their clipboard or share via their device's native share functionality. Example text: "Check out my team, the Rochester Rock-Eaters! We're currently ranked 3rd in the Gold Division! #RealmRivalry"
"Share a Player" Button: This would be accessible from an individual player's profile page but could also be featured here, allowing users to share a standout player's stats.
B. Referrals Tab
Purpose: To incentivize word-of-mouth marketing and reward players for bringing friends into the game.
UI:
Your Referral Code: Prominently displays the user's unique, personal referral code (e.g., JSMITH-12345). A "Copy Code" button should be next to it.
How It Works: A simple, step-by-step explanation:
"1. Share your code with a friend."
"2. Your friend enters the code when they create their account."
"3. Once your friend completes their first season, you both receive a reward!"
Rewards Display: Clearly lists the rewards for both the referrer and the new player (e.g., "You both receive: 50 Gems and 10,000 Credits!").
Tracked Referrals: A small list showing the status of referrals (e.g., "Friend 'PlayerX' has joined. Reward pending season completion.").
C. Redeem Code Tab
Purpose: A simple interface for users to enter special codes for rewards.
UI:
A single text input field labeled "Enter Code".
A "Redeem" button.
A text area below to display success or error messages (e.g., "Success! You received 25 Gems!", or "Error: Invalid or expired code.").
Logic: The system will check the entered code against a database of valid, active promotional codes.
D. Game Guide Tab
Purpose: This replaces the generic "Help" page with a more useful, integrated knowledge base. It's the in-game manual.
UI: A scrollable page with collapsible sections (accordions) for easy navigation.
Key Sections:
Getting Started: Explains the 17-day season cycle, how to play matches, and the basic goals.
Understanding Your Players: Details what each of the 8 attributes does, explains the Player Roles, and describes the unique racial modifiers.
Team Management: A guide to the Staff, Tactics & Stadium, and Finances tabs. Explains how each system works.
The Market: Explains how to buy, sell, and bid on players, and how the Recruiting system works.
Glossary: A simple A-Z list of key game terms (e.g., "CAR", "Knockdown", "Intimidation Factor") and their definitions.
