Lineup & Tactics Hub UI/UX Revamp
Goal: To redesign the game's primary tactics and lineup management screen. This new design replaces the previous rigid layout with a flexible, informative, and intuitive system for setting starters and managing positional substitutions.

1. Core Design Philosophy
Strategic Flexibility: The lineup system must support the new 2-2-1-1 "Wildcard" formation, allowing managers to choose their 6th starter based on their game plan.

Positional Clarity: Substitutes must be organized by role, making it easy to manage depth at each position.

Informed Decision-Making: The UI must provide critical at-a-glance player status information, specifically their current Stamina and Injury Status, directly on the lineup screen.

2. Proposed Layout: The Roster Board
The page will be structured as a single, interactive "Roster Board," divided into three main areas: the Available Players Pool, the Starting Lineup, and the Positional Substitution Bench.

3. Detailed Component Breakdown
A. Available Players Panel (Left Side)
This is the scrollable list of all healthy, available players on the user's team.

Enhanced Player Card: Each player in this list will be represented by a small, draggable card with more detailed information:

Player Name & Role Tag: e.g., "Stormcrusher Scarface" with a red "Blocker" tag.

Power Rating: The player's overall Power score (e.g., "23").

Stamina Bar & Percentage (NEW): A visual bar and percentage (e.g., 95%) showing the player's current daily_stamina_level. The bar should be color-coded (e.g., green > 70%, yellow 40-70%, red < 40%).

Injury Icon (NEW): If a player has a non-severe injury that still allows them to play (e.g., "Minor Injury"), a small medical icon will appear on their card as a warning. Severely injured players will not appear in this list.

B. Starting Lineup Panel (Top Right)
This section is where the user sets their 6 starters for the next match.

Slot Design: The layout is changed to reflect the new formation rules. There will be six clearly labeled drop zones:

Blocker 1 & Blocker 2

Runner 1 & Runner 2

Passer 1

WILDCARD: This slot should be visually distinct (e.g., with a different border color or icon) and can accept a player of any role.

Drag & Drop Functionality: Users drag player cards from the "Available Players" panel on the left and drop them into the appropriate starter slots. The system should only allow a Blocker to be dropped into a Blocker slot, a Runner into a Runner slot, etc., while the Wildcard slot accepts any role.

C. Positional Substitution Bench (Bottom Right)
This section is completely redesigned for clarity and strategic depth.

UI: The single "Substitutes" box is replaced by three separate, clearly labeled drop zones:

Substitute Blockers

Substitute Runners

Substitute Passers

Functionality: Users will drag players from the "Available Players" panel and drop them into the corresponding positional bench. This allows them to create a clear depth chart for each role.

This revamped design provides a much more powerful and intuitive interface for one of the most critical aspects of a management game. It gives the user the tactical flexibility you envisioned while providing all the necessary information to make smart lineup decisions.
