It looks like I've made good progress on aligning the core game systems with your specifications and adding initial tests. Here's a summary of what I've accomplished:

- I refactored `leagueService.ts` to handle player generation (rookies, roles, potential, UVF salary) and valuation.
- I added `processEndOfSeasonSkillProgression` to `leagueService.ts`.
- I created `tournamentService.ts` which includes logic for Daily Cups and Mid-Season Classics (creation, entry, AI fill, bracket generation).
- I updated `store_config.json` to match the "Consolidated Item & Store Database" and "Ad Rewards System" from your documents.
- I updated `storeRoutes.ts` to use the new store configuration, including ad reward logic and a basic item purchase flow.
- I updated `shared/schema.ts` for player potential, roles, inventory items, and new tables (tournaments, teamInventory, playerEquipment, etc.).
- I updated `itemStorage.ts` to manage `teamInventory` and added `addItemToTeamInventory`.
- I updated `adSystemStorage.ts` with `getTotalAdViewsCountByUser`.
- I updated `shared/config/abilities.json` to use tiered descriptive effects instead of direct stat bonuses.

For the UI Consistency Pass:
- In `Dashboard.tsx`, I enhanced the seasonal cycle display, added quick links, and integrated a notification center placeholder.
- In `Team.tsx`, I reorganized the main tabs (Roster, Staff, Tactics, Finances, Inventory). I also added sub-tabs for the Medical Center (Roster) and Contracts (Finances), and integrated the new `LineupRosterBoard` and `InventoryDisplay` components.
- In `Competition.tsx`, I restructured the Tournaments tab for new UI panels and began aligning the Exhibitions tab.
- In `Marketplace.tsx` (MarketHub), I added main hub tabs. `EnhancedMarketplace.tsx` (Player Marketplace) now has sub-tabs and enhanced filter placeholders.
- I aligned `UnifiedPlayerCard.tsx` with your specifications (Power calc, Potential display with scout range, Role-dependent key stats, Contract/Status section).
- I created `LineupRosterBoard.tsx` for the new tactics UI.
- I created `InventoryDisplay.tsx` for the new inventory UI.

Regarding Testing:
- I added unit tests for `leagueService.ts` covering player generation, valuation, and skill progression.
- I added unit tests for `tournamentService.ts` covering tournament creation, entry, AI fill, and bracket generation.
