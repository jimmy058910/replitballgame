Team Hub UI & UX Revamp
Goal: To redesign the game's primary team management interface (/team page) to be more intuitive, concise, and functionally organized. This revamp addresses user feedback by consolidating tabs, clarifying where key tasks are performed, and removing obsolete features.
1. Core Design Philosophy & High-Level Changes
Consolidation: The current 10+ tabs will be reorganized under a smaller set of logical parent tabs within the Team Hub. This reduces clutter and improves navigation flow.
Clarity of Purpose: Each tab will have a clear, distinct purpose, making it easy for users to find the tools they need.
Action-Oriented Design: Key management tasks like contract negotiation and injury recovery will have dedicated, easy-to-find locations.
2. Revamped Team Hub Tab Structure
The main navigation within the /team page will be simplified to these five core tabs:
Roster
Staff
Tactics
Finances
Inventory
(Note: The Stadium page remains a separate top-level item in the main site navigation as per your preference, and Recruiting is best suited for the Market hub as it's a form of player acquisition.)
3. Detailed Tab Content & Functional Breakdown
This section details what goes into each tab and directly answers your questions.
A. Roster Tab
Purpose: The central place for all player-related management.
Sub-Tabs:
Players: The main view, showing a list of all players on the roster. It should have the filter buttons you currently have (All, Passers, Runners, Blockers, Taxi Squad).
Medical Center (NEW): This is where you will manage team stamina and injuries. This new sub-tab provides a dedicated space for health management.
UI: It should feature two lists:
Injured Players: Shows only players who are currently injured, their injury type, and estimated recovery time. An "Apply Item" button next to each player allows for quick use of Medical Kits.
Fatigued Players: Shows all players with daily_stamina_level below a certain threshold (e.g., 75%). An "Apply Item" button allows for quick use of Stamina consumables.
B. Staff Tab
Purpose: Unchanged. Manage your coaching and support staff.
Sub-Tabs:
Current Staff: View your hired staff and their effects.
Hire New Staff: Browse and hire available staff from a "free agent" pool.
C. Tactics Tab
Purpose: Unchanged. Set your team's strategic approach.
Sub-Tabs:
Game Plan: Set your team's Team-Wide Tactical Focus (Balanced, All-Out Attack, etc.).
Effectiveness: (As seen in your screenshot) This is a great place for future analytics on how well your chosen tactics are performing.
D. Finances Tab
Purpose: A consolidated hub for all financial matters, including player contracts.
Sub-Tabs:
Overview: A dashboard showing your current balance, projected income, and expenses.
Contracts (Moved Here): This is where you will handle all contract negotiations. This page will list all players, their current salary, and their contract length. A "Negotiate" button will appear for players in the final year of their deal. This logically groups salaries and contract costs under the main Finances umbrella.
E. Inventory Tab
Purpose: Unchanged. View and manage all your owned items.
Filter Buttons:
Equipment | Consumables | Trophies
4. Removed Features
"Skills" Tab: As per your request, the Skills tab has been completely removed from the team hub navigation. The skills a player possesses will be visible on their detailed Player Card pop-up, but will no longer have their own dedicated management tab, simplifying the UI.
This revamped structure provides a much cleaner and more logical user experience. It directly answers your questions by creating a dedicated Medical Center for health management and moving Contracts into the Finances hub, all while decluttering the main navigation.
