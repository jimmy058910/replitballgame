Integrating Realm Rivalry’s Simulation Stack
Key takeaway: Unify every on-field event under a data-oriented Entity-Component-System (ECS) loop, propagate its effects deterministically through attributes, skills, coaching buffs, stadium modifiers, and morale chemistry, and then let a single “Broadcast Service” translate the final game state into tightly coupled statistics and commentary. This blueprint removes today’s piecemeal logic, guarantees that every line of commentary is statistically true, and gives designers one dial per mechanic for long-term balance.

1. Architectural Spine
1.1 Data-Oriented Core
Adopt a lightweight TypeScript ECS such as bitecs.

Represent every transient match entity—player, ball, crowd section, weather cell—as an EntityId with pure-data components (Physical, SkillSet, Stamina, Morale, EffectsBuffer, etc.).

Drive the simulation with a fixed-timestep scheduler (e.g., 50 ms “tick”) organised into ordered systems:

InputIntentSystem (AI & tactical decisions)

MovementSystem

InteractionSystem (tackles, passes, blocks)

EffectsSystem (buffs, debuffs, injuries)

StatisticsSystem

CommentarySystem

RenderSyncSystem (WebSocket diff to clients)

ECS will let you swap 2-D sprites for 2.5-D quads later with no gameplay rewrite and scales easily to 100 k entities.

1.2 Deterministic Randomness
Seed the RNG at kick-off with hash(matchId + seasonId). Recorded seeds make replays, e-sports broadcasting, and Balance-QA reproducible.

2. Unified Attribute & Skill Model
Layer	Purpose	Mechanics
Base Attributes	Permanent, 1-40 scale	Speed, Power, Agility, Throwing, Catching, Kicking, Stamina, Leadership
Race Modifiers	Applied once at creation	+3 AGI Sylvan, –3 POW Umbra, etc.
Dynamic States	Change every tick	currentStamina, morale, fatigue, injurySeverity
Skills	Intangible perks (4 tiers)	Stored as bit flags with stacks (PocketPresence_lv2)
Effects Buffer	Timed buffs/debuffs	JSON blob of (effectId, magnitude, ttl)
2.1 Live Stat Resolution
At the start of each possession the StatsResolver computes Effective Stats:

text
effectiveThrowing =
    baseThrowing
  + skillBonus("Deadeye")
  + coachBuff("QB Coach")
  + moraleScalar
  + stadiumNoisePenalty
  - fatiguePenalty
This single numeric is what all probability functions consume, guaranteeing commentary ≙ stats.

2.2 Fatigue Curve
Implement an S-curve to replace linear drains:
f
a
t
i
g
u
e
_
l
o
s
s

fatigue_loss=Δt× 
1+e 
−c

 (currentStamina−50)
 
c

 .
High-stamina players fade slower and regain vigor faster overnight—vital for roster depth realism.

3. Coaching & Staff Effects
Staff Role	Components added per tick	Example Buff Logic
Head Coach	TacticBias MoraleAura	+2% skill roll if strategy matches coach bias
Three Trainers	AttributeGradient	0.2% stamina regen per level during match pause
Recovery Specialist	InjuryMitigation	15% reduction in injury severity at time-of-impact
Scouts	Off-pitch but feed accurate attribute reveals	
Store coach ratings in the same 1-40 scale. Each system that uses an attribute can read a staff multiplier table once, then cache for that tick—no scattered if-blocks.

4. Stadium & Crowd Engine
4.1 Four Modular Components
Capacity & Density – sets raw attendance.

Amenities Level – scales concession/parking revenue.

Crowd Noise Index – drives stadiumNoisePenalty in Effective Stats.

Intimidation Factor – logistic of (fanLoyalty × density) bounded 0-100.

Meta-study shows modern home teams win ~57-63% across sports, so tune IntimidationFactor such that an average stadium confers +3% win probability; full 100 gives ~+9% (match one standard deviation of empirical data).

4.2 Weather/Lighting Slots
Reserve component IDs now (WeatherCondition, LightingRig) even if you fill them with defaults; adding rain or night games later will be trivial.

5. Commentary System 2.0
5.1 Single Source of Truth
Commentary must query the exact statistical deltas produced by the previous tick. Never let prompts recalculate yards or attempt chances on their own. Each commentary function receives:

text
{
  eventType,
  deltaStats,   // { rushingYards: 12, forcedFumble: true … }
  contextTags   // ['race=Umbra','skill=Juke','phase=Late']
}
5.2 Weighted Prompt Selection
Replace today’s fixed 30% race-flavor rule with softmax weights:
P(prompt) = exp(weight_context) / Σ exp(weight_all)
Start weights: neutral = 1.0, raceFlavor = 0.6, skillFlavor = 0.8. This drops race lines to ~18% organically.

5.3 Prompt Palette Expansion
Add missing clusters:

Defensive Skills – Counter-Juke, Read & React.

Special Formations – Wildcard trick plays, Heavy Block set.

Seasonal Stakes – “A win today clinches a playoff berth for …”

Maintain a Prompt Registry CSV with columns id|eventType|tags|weight|template, version-controlled so writers and designers collaborate without touching code.

5.4 Stat Integrity Guard
Unit test each prompt: feed a synthetic deltaStats and assert that the stats counters advance exactly as the template implies. This closes the attribution gaps flagged in your audit.

6. Statistics & Telemetry Pipeline
StatisticsSystem increments counters in an in-memory SoA (Structure of Arrays) block.

Every 5 seconds flush an immutable diff to Redis PUB/SUB for live clients and to Postgres for persistence.

A nightly ETL loads match snapshots into BigQuery for dashboards and balancing queries.

Expose a /api/matches/{id}/stats/live endpoint returning a Protobuf payload ≤ 8 kB for minimal latency.

7. Balancing & Tuning Framework
7.1 YAML-Driven Coefficient Store
All probability curves (injury, fumble, interception) live in /config/sim_coefficients.yml. Designers can run an A/B seed suite:

bash
pnpm sim-batch --config configs/balance/test-A.yml --matches 5000 --seed 42
Generate CSVs of outcome distributions; accept change when target mean ±5% vs spec.

7.2 Monte-Carlo Stadium ROI
Include a StadiumFinanceSimulator script that draws attendance from a beta distribution shaped by capacity & loyalty, projecting payback period for upgrades—useful for your in-game finance panel.

8. Testing & QA
Layer	Test Type	Tooling
ECS Systems	Property-based	fast-check
Prompt Integrity	Snapshot diff	Jest + JSON fixtures
Determinism	Seed replay	Jest + hash comparison
Performance	10 k entity soak	Node Worker Threads
WebSocket	Simulated 1,000 clients	Artillery

Conclusion
By refactoring Realm Rivalry’s live match into a deterministic ECS and funnelling every modifier—attributes, skills, coaches, stadium, camaraderie—through a single Effective Stats calculation, you eliminate hidden couplings and guarantee statistical truth. Layering a weight-based commentary service on top turns that data into immersive narrative without ever drifting out of sync. Finally, YAML coefficients, Monte-Carlo finance simulators, and replayable seeds give designers levers for endless tuning without code changes. The result is a cohesive, engaging simulation where every roar of the crowd and every line of commentary precisely mirrors the numbers underneath—exactly what a modern fantasy sports manager deserves.
