Live Match Simulation System
Goal: To create a dynamic, text-based match simulation engine that integrates all established game systems (player stats, skills, roles, tactics, coaching, atmosphere) to produce an engaging, narrative-driven play-by-play commentary.
1. Pre-Game Setup & Modifier Calculation
Before the simulation begins, the system must calculate all temporary modifiers that will affect players for the duration of the match.
A. Home Field Advantage:
Identify the home team.
Load the home team's chosen Field Size ("Standard", "Large", "Small").
Apply the corresponding gameplay effects as passive modifiers for all players for this match (e.g., for a "Small" field, add a temporary +2 bonus to the power attribute of all home team players).
Calculate the home team's IntimidationFactor based on their FanLoyalty and the match's AttendanceRate.
Apply the "Crowd Noise" debuff (e.g., -3 to Catching and Throwing) to all away team players for this match.
B. Tactical & Coaching Modifiers:
Load each team's chosen Team-Wide Tactical Focus ("Balanced", "All-Out Attack", "Defensive Wall").
Load each team's Head Coach and their Tactics stat.
Calculate the effectiveness of each team's chosen tactic based on their coach's skill. A high-Tactics coach amplifies the pros and mitigates the cons of their chosen strategy. These modifiers will be checked by the AI during decision-making.
C. Single-Game Boosts:
Check the active_boosts list for the user's team.
For each active boost, apply the temporary stat increase to the specified player (e.g., Player5.speed += 5).
2. The Simulation Loop (The "Turn")
The game progresses in "turns," where each turn represents a few seconds of game time. The core loop should be:
Tick the Clock: Advance the in-game clock.
Determine Game State: Is the ball loose or possessed? Who has it?
Execute Player AI: For every player on the field, determine their action for this turn based on the game state and their role (e.g., move, pass, tackle, block).
Resolve Actions: Calculate the outcome of any major actions (passes, tackles) that were initiated.
Generate Commentary: Based on the actions and outcomes, generate a line of text for the play-by-play log.
Update Player Stamina: Deplete or recover in_game_stamina for all players based on their actions this turn.
Loop: Repeat until the half-time or final whistle.
3. Action Resolution & Dynamic Commentary
This is the heart of the engine. Hereâ€™s how to resolve key events and generate text for them.
A. The Run Play
Event: A "Runner" with the ball decides to run.
Logic:
The Runner moves forward a small amount.
Check for nearby defenders. If a defender is close, initiate a Tackle Contest.
If no defender is close, check for a Breakaway Chance (Runner.speed vs. closest_defender.speed). A high differential gives a small chance for the Runner to break free for a big gain.
Check for the "Juke Move" or "Truck Stick" skills if a tackle is attempted.
Commentary Prompts for Replit AI:
"Generate 10 lines for a short, tough run up the middle for a 3-yard gain."
"Write 10 exciting lines for a Runner with high Agility using their Juke Move skill to make a defender miss."
"Create 10 commentary lines for a Runner with high Power using their Truck Stick skill to run over a smaller defender."
"Describe a breakaway run where a fast player finds a seam and sprints for a huge gain."
B. The Pass Play
Event: A "Passer" decides to throw the ball.
Logic:
The Passer's AI uses find_open_teammate_with_score() to select the best target.
The pass's accuracy is determined by Passer.throwing and modified by Deadeye skill or "Clutch Time" effects.
The ball's "air time" is calculated.
When the ball arrives, any nearby player can attempt a catch. The outcome is based on Catcher.catching, the "Target Locking Lite" bonus/penalty, and situational modifiers ("Clutch Time," "Crowd Noise").
Commentary Prompts for Replit AI:
"Write 10 lines for a Passer with the Pocket Presence skill gracefully avoiding pressure before making a throw."
"Generate commentary for a perfect pass, describing it as a 'laser beam' or 'dropped in a bucket'."
"Create 10 lines for an interception, describing the defender reading the Passer's eyes and jumping the route."
"Describe a contested catch where a receiver with high Catching out-muscles a defender for the ball."
C. The Block / Tackle
Event: A Blocker engages an opponent, or a defender tackles the carrier.
Logic:
Resolve the contest using Attacker.power vs. Target.agility.
If the attacker is a Blocker with the "Pancake Block" skill, a successful block has a chance to cause a longer knockdown.
If the target is a Gryll with the "Unshakeable" skill, they get a bonus to their agility for the roll.
Commentary Prompts for Replit AI:
"Write 15 variations of commentary for a Blocker absolutely leveling an opponent who didn't have the ball. Use impactful words like 'pancaked', 'demolished', 'sent into next week'."
"Generate commentary for a critical, game-saving tackle near the end zone."
"Describe a Blocker successfully holding their block, creating a clean pocket for their Passer."
D. Situational & Atmospheric Commentary
Logic: Periodically check for game state conditions.
Commentary Prompts for Replit AI:
"Generate 5 lines for when a team is in 'Protect the Lead' mode, focusing on safe, clock-draining plays."
"Write 5 lines for when a team is in 'Desperate Measures' mode, highlighting risky deep passes and frantic play."
"Create commentary that mentions the home crowd's noise level and its apparent effect on the away team when the IntimidationFactor is high."
"Write commentary that mentions a player's low stamina affecting their play (e.g., 'He looks exhausted out there, a step slower than usual.')."
