I watched the whole /match/40 from start to finish and here's what I observed, and attached an image for reference.

Clutch time should only be towards the end of the 2nd half.
Early game should not be at the beginning of the 2nd half.

Game doesn't appear to be running the engine successfully. Only get the same few prompts, with no mentions of players, scoring, passing, catching, etc.
I tried to copy and paste the bulk of the game log below.

Game should show the score, 0-0

Where it says Key Performers, that never changes and shows there from the beginning to end of the game. I believe this to be hardcoded.

A halftime ad/break didn't occur either.

Game ended, and nothing occurred. Still showing as a Live Match on Dashboard and /competition
