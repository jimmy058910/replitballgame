Unified Player Progression & Development System
Goal: To design a single, comprehensive system for organic player development. This system replaces traditional XP/leveling with a dynamic, formula-driven approach where player attributes evolve based on a combination of their innate potential, age, on-field activity, performance, and the quality of the team's staff.

1. Core Progression Philosophy
Organic Growth: Players do not earn XP or "Development Points." Instead, their daily activities grant them chances to improve their stats, simulating natural development.

Activity Hierarchy: The system rewards activity across all game modes, with a clear hierarchy of importance: League > Tournament > Exhibition.

Career Arcs: Players experience distinct phases: rapid development when young, a stable prime, and a gradual decline in old age.

Daily & Seasonal Events: Small progression checks happen daily, while major development, decline, and retirement events happen at the end of each season.

2. The Daily Progression System (3 AM Reset)
This is the primary engine of player growth and runs once per day for every player on a roster.

Step 1: Calculate Daily ActivityScore
First, the system calculates a score based on the player's participation in the previous day's games.

Formula:
ActivityScore = (LeagueGamesPlayed * 10) + (TournamentGamesPlayed * 7) + (ExhibitionGamesPlayed * 2)

Performance Bonus: If the player was a standout performer (e.g., scored multiple points, had many knockdowns), add a small bonus to their ActivityScore (e.g., +5 points).

Step 2: Determine Number of "Progression Rolls"
The ActivityScore determines how many chances a player gets to improve their stats that day. This directly rewards activity.

Formula:
NumberOfRolls = floor(ActivityScore / 5)

Example: A player plays 1 League game (10 pts) and 3 Exhibition games (6 pts) for a total ActivityScore of 16. They get floor(16 / 5) = 3 Progression Rolls for that day.

Step 3: Execute Progression Rolls
For each "roll" the player has earned:

A single attribute is randomly selected for a potential increase.

The system then calculates the ProgressionChance for that specific attribute.

If a random check against this chance succeeds, the attribute increases by +1 (if it is not already at its potential-defined cap).

Step 4: The ProgressionChance Formula
This complex formula determines the likelihood of a successful stat increase for each roll.

ProgressionChance = BaseChance + PotentialModifier + AgeModifier + StaffModifier + CamaraderieModifier + InjuryModifier + Luck

BaseChance (e.g., 5%): A small underlying chance for any stat to improve.

PotentialModifier (The Ceiling): The most significant factor, based on the stat's 1-5 star potential.

1-Star: +5% chance | 2-Stars: +10% | 3-Stars: +20% | 4-Stars: +30% | 5-Stars: +40%

AgeModifier (The Career Arc):

Youth (16-23): +15% bonus chance.

Prime (24-30): +5% bonus chance.

Veteran (31+): -20% penalty chance.

Physical Decline Exception: Players aged 34+ cannot have a successful progression check for Speed, Agility, or Power.

StaffModifier (The Coaching Effect):

Each Trainer provides a bonus to their specific attributes: TrainerBonus = Trainer.Teaching_Stat * 0.15%.

This bonus is then amplified by the Head Coach: FinalStaffBonus = TrainerBonus * (1 + (HeadCoach.Development_Stat / 100)).

CamaraderieModifier (The Team Environment):

CamaraderieModifier = (player.camaraderie - 50) * 0.05%. A happy, cohesive team environment fosters growth.

InjuryModifier (NEW):

A player who is currently injured finds it harder to train and improve.

Minor Injury: -5% penalty chance.

Moderate Injury: -15% penalty chance.

Severe Injury: Player is ineligible for any progression checks.

Luck (The Random Factor):

A small random value, e.g., randf_range(-1.0, 1.0)%, to add unpredictability.

3. End-of-Season Events (Day 17)
While progression is now handled daily, the end of the season is for major career-arc events.

A. Age-Related Stat Decline

Players 31 or older have a (Age - 30) * 2.5% chance to lose 1 point in a random physical stat (Speed, Agility, Power).

B. Retirement System

Players 35 or older have a chance to retire based on the formula: RetirementChance = BaseAgeChance + (CareerInjuries * 2%) + (LowPlayingTimeModifier). Players at age 45 automatically retire.

This unified system creates a deep, interconnected web of factors that drive player development daily, making every game played and every management decision meaningful for the long-term success of the user's team.
