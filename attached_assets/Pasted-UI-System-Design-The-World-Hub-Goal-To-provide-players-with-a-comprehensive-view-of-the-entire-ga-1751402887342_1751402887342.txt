UI System Design: The World Hub
Goal: To provide players with a comprehensive view of the entire game world, fostering a sense of global competition and community beyond their immediate league. This hub is for information and discovery.
1. Top-Level Tabs
The World Hub organizes global information into three intuitive sections:
Divisions
Leaderboards
Lookup
2. Tab Content Breakdown
A. Divisions Tab
Purpose: Allows users to browse the entire league structure of the game.
UI:
Division Selector: A primary set of tabs or a dropdown menu at the top to select the Division Tier (e.g., Diamond (1), Platinum (2), Gold (3), etc.).
League Selector (for Div 2-8): Once a Division is selected, if it has multiple parallel leagues (e.g., Platinum A, Platinum B), a secondary set of tabs or a dropdown appears to select the specific league.
Standings Display: The main content area displays the full 8-team (or 16-team for Div 1) standings table for the selected league, identical in format to the user's own league standings (Rank, Team Name, W-L-T, PTS, DIFF, Streak).
Clickable Teams: Every team name in the standings table should be a clickable link that takes the user to that team's public profile page (via the Lookup system).
B. Leaderboards Tab
Purpose: To showcase the top performers across the entire game world, giving players individual goals to strive for.
Sub-Tabs:
Player Stats:
Filter/Dropdown: A dropdown menu to select the specific stat leaderboard to view (e.g., Scores, Passing Yards, Rushing Yards, Tackles, Knockdowns Inflicted, Interceptions).
Display: A ranked list showing the Top 100 (or more) players in that category, displaying Rank, Player Name, Team Name, and the relevant Stat Value.
Team Stats:
Filter/Dropdown: A dropdown menu to select the team-based leaderboard (e.g., Highest Team Power (CAR), Most Points For (PF), Fewest Points Against (PA), Best Point Differential (DIFF)).
Display: A ranked list of the Top 100 teams for that category.
C. Lookup Tab
Purpose: A powerful search tool for finding any specific player or team in the game.
Sub-Tabs:
Player Search:
UI: A simple search bar.
Functionality: The user can type a player's name. The system returns a list of matching players. Clicking a result opens that player's public profile.
Public Player Profile: Shows the player's name, role, race, age, all 8 attributes (potentially shown as a range if the user's Head Scout level is low), and their current season's stats. It does not show contract details or potential ratings.
Team Search:
UI: A simple search bar.
Functionality: The user can type a team's name. The system returns a list of matching teams. Clicking a result opens that team's public profile.
Public Team Profile: Shows the team's name, logo, current W-L-T record, division/rank, and a list of their publicly visible roster.
