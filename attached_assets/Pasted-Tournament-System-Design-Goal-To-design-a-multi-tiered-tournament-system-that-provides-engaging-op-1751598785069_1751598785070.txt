Tournament System Design
Goal: To design a multi-tiered tournament system that provides engaging, optional competitive gameplay for players at all levels. This system is structured to complement the core league season, offering distinct challenges, rewards, and consequences.

1. Tournament Philosophy
Tournaments serve as high-stakes, high-reward events that exist outside of the regular season standings. They are designed to test a team's skill in a concentrated, single-elimination format and provide opportunities for significant financial gain and prestige.

The system is divided into two distinct types:

Daily Divisional Cups: A low-barrier, daily activity for consistent engagement.

The Mid-Season Classic: A rare, high-prestige event that marks the midpoint of each season.

2. The Daily Divisional Cup
This is the workhorse tournament, offering players a chance to compete for a modest prize every single day.

Frequency: Runs once per day. Registration is open for a 24-hour window, with the tournament simulating at a set time (e.g., 8 PM EST).

Eligibility: A player can only enter the cup for their current division.

Note: Division 1 (Diamond Division) does not have a Daily Cup. This tournament is available for Divisions 2 through 8.

Format: A small, single-elimination bracket (e.g., 8 or 16 teams). If there are not enough user sign-ups by the deadline, the remaining slots will be filled by AI-controlled teams from that division.

Game Length: Short, like Exhibition games.

Entry Fee: Requires a "Tournament Entry" consumable item.

Rewards:

The prize pool is modest, designed to be a helpful boost but not a replacement for league income.

No trophy is awarded for winning a Daily Cup.

3. The Mid-Season Classic
This is the premier tournament of the regular seasonâ€”a special event that offers significant rewards and prestige.

Frequency: Occurs once per season, on Day 7. The tournament simulates at a fixed time (e.g., 1 PM EST). Registration is open only on Day 6.

Eligibility: Open to any team willing to pay the entry fee. The tournament is bracketed by division, including Division 1.

Format: A 16-team single-elimination tournament. If not enough users sign up for a division's bracket, the remaining slots are filled by high-ranking AI teams from that division.

Game Length: Standard, like League games.

Entry Fee: Has a direct entry fee (no item required).

Suggested Cost: 10,000 Credits or 20 Gems.

Rewards: The prize pool is substantial. The winner receives a unique Mid-Season Classic Trophy.

4. Player Impact & Progression Effects (NEW SECTION)
This section details the physical toll and developmental benefits of participating in tournaments.

Effect

Daily Divisional Cup

Mid-Season Classic

Lasting Injury Risk

Low. The base_injury_chance for these games is significantly lower than in league play (e.g., 5%).

Normal. The base_injury_chance is the same as a League game (e.g., 20%), reflecting the higher intensity.

daily_stamina_level Cost

Minimal. Each player who participates loses a small amount of their persistent stamina (e.g., -10 points).

High. The cost is the same as a League game (e.g., -30 points), making participation a strategic choice that affects league readiness.

Player Progression

Moderate. Each tournament game played contributes to a player's ActivityScore for the end-of-season progression check, but at a lower rate than league games.

High. Each game played contributes to a player's ActivityScore at the same high rate as a League game.

This two-tiered tournament system provides both consistent, low-risk daily engagement for developing teams and a high-stakes, prestigious seasonal event for all divisions, with clear trade-offs in terms of player fatigue and potential for injury.
