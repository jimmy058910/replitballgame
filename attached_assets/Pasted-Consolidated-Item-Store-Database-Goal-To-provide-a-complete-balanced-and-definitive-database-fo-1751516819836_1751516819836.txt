Consolidated Item & Store Database
Goal: To provide a complete, balanced, and definitive database for all in-game items. This document supersedes previous versions and aligns with the core design principle of being "Free-to-Play Friendly" by removing pay-to-win mechanics and ensuring all gameplay-affecting items are accessible via Credits.

1. Guiding Principles
No Pay-to-Win: Direct competitive advantages (like permanent stat points or exclusive top-tier gear) cannot be purchased only with Gems.

Credits are King: Credits (â‚¡) are the primary currency for progression. All items with stat bonuses must have a Credit price.

Gems for Convenience & Cosmetics: Gems (ðŸ’Ž) are for accelerating gameplay (e.g., extra entries) and purchasing exclusive cosmetic items (later integration/feature), not for buying power.

2. Currency & Exchange
Currencies: Credits (â‚¡) and Gems (ðŸ’Ž).

Gem Exchange Rates (Tiered System):

10 gems = 4,500 credits (450:1 ratio)

50 gems = 25,000 credits (500:1 ratio)

300 gems = 165,000 credits (550:1 ratio)

1,000 gems = 600,000 credits (600:1 ratio)

3. Equipment Database
This list replaces the generic "Basic/Advanced/Elite" items with the thematic, race-specific equipment we designed.

C. Removed Item Categories

The following item types from the Replit AI document have been REMOVED to align with a fair, non-P2W economy:

Training Packages / Credit Packages: Player progression must be earned through gameplay and staff management, not purchased.

Contract Management Items: Contract negotiation should be a core management challenge, not bypassed with items.

5. Other Systems
Scouting:

The "Scouting Report" items are REMOVED.

Scouting effectiveness is determined solely by the level of the Head Scout staff member, as per our game_systems_design_v6 document. A better scout provides more accurate information.

Game Entries:

Exhibition Match Entry: 5,000 â‚¡ or 5 ðŸ’Ž.

Tournament Entry: Fees must be scaled by division, as defined in the main Economy document. The flat pricing is incorrect.

6. Ad Rewards System (New)
This system is designed to reward player engagement and provide a valuable resource stream for free-to-play users.

A. Core Mechanics

Daily Watch Limit: A user can watch a maximum of 10 rewarded ads per day. The limit resets daily at 3 AM EST.

Premium Box Milestone: A persistent counter tracks the total number of ads watched by the user. Every time this counter reaches 50, the user is awarded a Premium Box and the counter resets to 0.

B. Individual Ad Rewards

Each of the 10 daily ads provides a small, but useful, amount of Credits. To add variety, the reward can be randomized from a small pool.

Reward Structure: Upon watching an ad, the user receives one of the following, chosen randomly:

70% Chance: 250 Credits

25% Chance: 500 Credits

5% Chance: 1,000 Credits

C. The Premium Box (Milestone Reward)

The Premium Box is a major reward for consistent engagement. When opened, it grants the user one reward from each of the following three categories, resulting in a bundle of valuable items.

Category 1: Currency (Guaranteed)

80% Chance: 10,000 Credits

15% Chance: 25,000 Credits

5% Chance: 10 Gems

Category 2: Consumables (Guaranteed)

60% Chance: 2x Advanced Recovery Serum

30% Chance: 2x Advanced Treatment

10% Chance: 1x Phoenix Elixir

Category 3: Equipment (Guaranteed)

75% Chance: A random Uncommon quality equipment item.

20% Chance: A random Rare quality equipment item.

5% Chance: A random Epic quality equipment item (excluding Cosmetic-Only items).

This system ensures that watching ads provides both immediate small gains (Credits) and a significant, exciting milestone reward (Premium Box), making it a compelling feature for daily engagement.
