 Roster Player Card UI & UX Revamp
Goal: To redesign the player summary card used in the main Roster view. This design will align with the aesthetics and data representation of the new detailed Player Card, providing a more intuitive, informative, and visually clear at-a-glance summary of each player.

1. Core Problems & Design Philosophy
Problem: The current roster card displays information that is inconsistent with our revamped systems. The role tag has readability issues, and key information like a player's overall potential is missing.

Solution: We will redesign the card to be a true summary of the detailed player profile. It will prioritize the most important metrics for a manager making quick roster decisions: overall ability (Power), future potential (Stars), and critical status alerts (Injury).

2. Proposed Roster Card Layout
Below is a mockup and detailed breakdown of the new Roster Card layout.

(Note: The label "CAR" in the mockup image should now be read as "Power")

3. Detailed Component Breakdown
A. Header Section
Player Name: "Battlecry Ragemaw" remains the primary text.

Role Tag (High Contrast): The role tag is updated to use the same high-contrast color scheme as the full player card.

Blocker: Red background with white text.

Runner: Green background with white text.

Passer: Yellow background with black text.

Race & Age Info: "Gryll • Age 24" remains, providing key context.

B. Core Rating Section (Top Right)
This section is completely revamped to show the most important summary metrics.

Power Rating:

The old "Power" score is replaced with a new, more comprehensive Power rating.

This rating is the average of the player's 6 core athletic stats (Speed, Power, Agility, Throwing, Catching, Kicking). This provides a single, easy-to-understand number on the same 1-40 scale as the attributes.

Color-Coding: The Power value itself is color-coded using the same system as individual stats for instant quality assessment (e.g., Red for 1-15, White for 16-25, Green for 26-34, Blue for 35-40).

Potential Rating:

Below the Power rating, the player's overall Potential is displayed using the 0-5 star system (including half-stars).

This rating will reflect scouting accuracy (e.g., showing a range like "3.5 - 4.5 Stars" if the scout level is low).

C. Attribute Summary Section
The list of individual stats is REMOVED from this summary view to reduce clutter. It is replaced by three summary ratings that give a quicker understanding of the player's capabilities.

Passing Rating: A calculated score based on Throwing and Leadership.

Mobility Rating: A calculated score based on Speed and Agility.

Power Rating (Sub-Rating): A calculated score based on the individual Power and Stamina attributes.

Visuals: Each rating is displayed with its numerical value and a simple progress bar, color-coded based on its value.

D. Status Icon Section (Bottom)
This new section provides critical, at-a-glance status information.

Injury Status: A prominent icon (e.g., a red medical cross) appears if the player has any injury status other than "Healthy." Hovering over the icon could show details ("Minor Injury - 3 Days").

Contract Status: An icon (e.g., a yellow exclamation point) appears if the player is in the final year of their contract, alerting the user that action is needed soon.

(Removed from this view): The player's specific salary is removed to clean up the card, as it's less critical for at-a-glance evaluation and is readily available in the full profile.

This revamped design creates a roster view that is cleaner, more consistent with the detailed player card, and provides managers with the most important information—overall power, future potential, and critical status—right where they need it.
