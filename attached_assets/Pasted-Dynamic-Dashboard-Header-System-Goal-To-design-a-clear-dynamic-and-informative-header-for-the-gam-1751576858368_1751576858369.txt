Dynamic Dashboard Header System
Goal: To design a clear, dynamic, and informative header for the game's Dashboard. This system will provide at-a-glance information about the current season number and the specific phase of the 17-day season cycle, with text that updates daily to create a sense of urgency and progression.

1. Season Display
Current System: Displays a static year, e.g., "Season 2025".

Refined System: The season will be represented by a simple, incrementing number to track a team's history and progress.

Implementation: The game will start at "Season 1". At the end of each 17-day cycle (on Day 17, just before the new season begins), this number will increment by 1.

2. Dynamic Phase-Based Display
The header will change its content based on the current day in the 17-day cycle. Each phase will have a unique title, description, and dynamic countdown timer.

Phase 1: Regular Season (Days 1-14)
This phase is about the daily grind of league competition.

3. Visual & UI Suggestions
Visual Hierarchy: The Phase Title should be the most prominent text. The Countdown should also be large and clear. The Description and Dynamic Detail can be smaller, secondary text.

Phase Badges: Using distinct colors and styles for the "Regular Season," "PLAYOFFS," and "Off-Season" badges provides an instant visual cue for the user about the current game state.

Progress Bar: During the Regular Season, consider adding a simple visual progress bar that fills up from Day 1 to Day 14, giving a clear visual representation of how far into the season the user is.

This revamped system provides users with much more context and creates a living, breathing timeline for the game world, making each day of the 17-day cycle feel unique and important.
