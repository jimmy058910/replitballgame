Unified Roster Card UI & UX Revamp
Goal: To create a single, unified design for the player summary card used throughout the game. This design is based on the preferred darker aesthetic and is enhanced to display more relevant, role-dependent information, providing managers with all necessary at-a-glance data.

1. Core Design Principles
Unification: One card design to be used everywhere (Dashboard, Roster page, etc.) for consistency.

Information Density: The card must be concise but rich with the most critical information: overall power, future potential, key role-based stats, and contract status.

Visual Clarity: High-contrast elements and color-coding will be used to make information easy to parse instantly.

2. Proposed Roster Card Layout
The design is an evolution of the preferred "Battlecry Ragemaw" card.

3. Detailed Component Breakdown
A. Header Section (Top)
Player Name: "Battlecry Ragemaw" - Remains the primary text.

Role Tag: Uses the high-contrast color scheme for instant recognition.

Blocker: Red background with white text.

Runner: Green background with white text.

Passer: Yellow background with black text.

Race & Age Info: "Gryll • Age 24" remains.

B. Core Ratings Section (Top Right)
Overall Power Rating:

Labeled clearly as "Power".

This rating is the average of the player's 6 core athletic stats (Speed, Power, Agility, Throwing, Catching, Kicking).

The numerical value is color-coded for quality (Red < 16, White 16-25, Green 26-34, Blue 35+).

Potential Rating:

Displayed directly below the Power rating.

Uses a 0 to 5-star system (including half-stars).

This rating must reflect scouting accuracy (e.g., showing a range like "3.5 - 4.5 Stars" if the scout level is low).

C. Role-Dependent Key Stats (NEW)
This section replaces the three summary bars (Passing, Mobility, Power).

It now displays the six most important individual attributes for the player's specific role, allowing for quick, relevant assessment.

Each stat is displayed as a three-letter abbreviation with its color-coded numerical value.

Stats for "Passer":

THR (Throwing)

AGI (Agility)

SPD (Speed)

CAT (Catching)

STA (Stamina)

LDR (Leadership)

Stats for "Runner":

SPD (Speed)

AGI (Agility)

PWR (Power)

CAT (Catching)

STA (Stamina)

KCK (Kicking - for punt/kick return versatility)

Stats for "Blocker":

PWR (Power)

AGI (Agility)

SPD (Speed)

STA (Stamina)

LDR (Leadership)

CAT (Catching - for recovering fumbles/interceptions)

D. Contract & Status Section (Bottom)
This new section adds crucial management information directly to the card.

Salary: Salary: ₡2,540 / season

Contract Length: Contract: 2 seasons remaining

Status Icons:

Injury Icon (Red Cross): Appears only if the player is injured.

Expiring Contract Icon (Yellow Exclamation Point): Appears only if the player is in their final contract season.

This unified design provides a much richer at-a-glance view, tailored to what a manager needs to know for each specific player role, while maintaining a clean and modern aesthetic.
