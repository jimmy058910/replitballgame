Individual Player Stats

Offensive Stats
Scores: (From your list) The most important stat. Absolutely essential.

Passing Attempts: To track how often a player tries to pass.

Passes Completed: (From your list) Crucial for measuring a Passer's effectiveness.

Passing Percentage: (From your list) A calculated stat (Completions / Attempts) that immediately shows efficiency.

Passing Yards: (New Suggestion) Tracking the total yards gained on completed passes gives a great measure of a Passer's impact, distinguishing short-yardage passers from those who make big plays.

Rushing Yards: (Refinement of "Yards Gained") Specifically tracks yards gained while running with the ball.

Catches:

Receiving Yards: (New Suggestion) The yards gained after making a catch. This is a key stat for Runners.

Drops & Fumbles: (New Suggestion) A negative stat that adds a lot of depth. Tracks when a player fails a catch check on a good pass, or fumbles after a tackle. High numbers here can be a liability.

Defensive Stats
Tackles: (From your list) A successful tackle that stops the ball carrier.

Knockdowns Inflicted: (Refinement of your "Knock downs" & "Injuries enforced") This is a perfect stat for your Blocker role. It should count any time they successfully knock down an opponent, whether that opponent has the ball or not (via their "aggressive tackle" ability). This makes their disruptive play quantifiable.

Interceptions: (From your list) A game-changing defensive play. Essential.

Passes Defended: (New Suggestion) This is for when a defender doesn't make an interception but causes an incompletion, perhaps by getting close enough to disrupt the catch. It gives value to defenders who aren't necessarily great catchers.

Team Stats

Passing Yards

Rushing Yards

Time of Possession: (New Suggestion) In a non-stop game, this is a huge indicator of which team is controlling the flow and wearing the other team down. You'd track the cumulative game time each team possesses the ball.

Turnovers: A simple count of Interceptions Thrown + Fumbles Lost. This is a critical stat for determining why a team won or lost.

Total Knockdowns: A measure of the team's overall physical dominance, great for seeing if a team of Blockers is having an impact.
