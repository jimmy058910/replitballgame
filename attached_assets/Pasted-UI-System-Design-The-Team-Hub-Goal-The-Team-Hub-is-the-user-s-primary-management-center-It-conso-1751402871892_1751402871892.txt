UI System Design: The Team Hub
Goal: The Team Hub is the user's primary management center. It consolidates all aspects of their internal assets—players, staff, finances, and infrastructure—into one organized location.
1. Top-Level Tabs
The Team Hub will feature a clear set of top-level tabs for navigation:
Roster
Staff
Tactics & Stadium
Finances
Inventory
2. Tab Content Breakdown
A. Roster Tab
Purpose: View, filter, and manage all players on the team.
Sub-Tabs / Filters:
All Players: A list of every player on the roster.
Passers | Runners | Blockers: Filtered lists showing only players with that specific role.
Taxi Squad (or "Reserves"): A place for developmental players who don't count against the main roster limit but also don't play in games (a potential future feature).
UI:
Each player is represented by a row in a table or a player card.
Key info at a glance: Name, Role, Age, Core Athleticism Rating (CAR), Injury Status.
Clicking on a player row opens their Detailed Player Profile.
Player Profile Screen:
Shows the player's portrait, name, role, race, and age.
Displays all 8 core attributes (Speed, Power, etc.) and their current values.
Shows their learned Skills and their current tier.

Sub-Tabs:
Current Staff: Displays the user's hired staff members, their level, key attributes (e.g., Head Coach's Motivation), and their current salary.
Hire New Staff: Shows a list of available staff for hire, acting as a "Free Agent" pool for staff. Users can see their stats and hiring costs.
