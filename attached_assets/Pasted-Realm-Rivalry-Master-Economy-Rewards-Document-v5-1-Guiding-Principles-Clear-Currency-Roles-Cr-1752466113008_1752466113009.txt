Realm Rivalry: Master Economy & Rewards Document (v5)
1. Guiding Principles
Clear Currency Roles: Credits (â‚¡) are the primary "Grind & Operate" currency earned through gameplay. Gems (ðŸ’Ž) are the premium "Convenience & Cosmetics" currency.

Balanced Loop: An average player's credit income should slightly exceed mandatory costs (salaries, maintenance), allowing for gradual progression and strategic spending.

Rewarding Success: Climbing divisions and winning championships provides the most significant rewards, creating a strong incentive for competitive play.

Fair Monetization ("Free-to-Play Friendly"): Core competitive advantages (i.e., stat-boosting items) must be accessible via Credits. Gems are for accelerating gameplay (e.g., extra entries) and purchasing exclusive cosmetic items (a future feature), not for buying exclusive power.

2. Monetization Packages
A. Gem Store Packages
Direct Gem purchases with increasing value for larger packs.

3. Currency & Starting Setup
Credits (â‚¡): Starting Amount: 50,000 Credits for new teams.

Gems (ðŸ’Ž): Starting Amount: 0 Gems for new teams.

Gem-to-Credit Exchange (Tiered System):

10 Gems => 4,000 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 400 Credits)

50 Gems => 22,500 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 450 Credits)

300 Gems => 150,000 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 500 Credits)

1000 Gems => 550,000 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 550 Credits)

4. Stadium & Financial Mechanics
This section details the core income and expenses that drive a team's economy.

A. Fan Attendance Algorithm
Attendance for home games is dynamic and crucial for income. It's calculated on a per-game basis.

Formula: Attendance = BaseCapacity * DivisionModifier * FanLoyaltyModifier * WinStreakModifier

Base Capacity: The current seat capacity of your stadium.

Division Modifier: Fans are more interested in higher-level play.

Div 1: 1.2x | Div 2: 1.1x | Div 3: 1.05x | Div 4: 1.0x | Div 5: 0.95x | Div 6: 0.9x | Div 7: 0.85x | Div 8: 0.8x

Fan Loyalty Modifier (0.75x to 1.25x): A persistent stat (0-100%) representing fan happiness. It increases with wins and stadium improvements (Lighting/Screens) and decays with losses or long periods of inactivity.

Win Streak Modifier (1.0x to 1.5x): A temporary boost for exciting play.

3-game streak: 1.1x | 5-game streak: 1.25x | 8+ game streak: 1.5x. Resets on loss.

Marketplace Listing Fee: 2% of a player's asking price, charged upon listing.

D. Stadium & Facility Upgrades
Upgrades are significant credit sinks that provide long-term income boosts. Costs scale exponentially.

1 Season Contract: 1.2x Modifier (High risk, high cost)

2 Season Contract: 1.0x Modifier (Standard)

3 Season Contract: 0.85x Modifier (Long-term investment discount)

Staff Salary Formulas (Skill 1-100):

Head Coach: 15,000 â‚¡ + (CoachSkill * 250 â‚¡). Required for team boosts.

A. Core Mechanics
Daily Watch Limit: A user can watch a maximum of 10 rewarded ads per day. The limit resets daily at 3 AM EST.

Each of the 10 daily ads provides a small, but useful, amount of Credits.

Reward Structure: Upon watching an ad, the user receives one of the following, chosen randomly:

70% Chance: 250 Credits

25% Chance: 500 Credits

5% Chance: 1,000 Credits

C. The Premium Box (Milestone Reward)
When opened, this box grants one reward from each of the following three categories:

Category 1: Currency (Guaranteed)

80% Chance: 10,000 Credits

15% Chance: 25,000 Credits

5% Chance: 10 Gems

20% Chance: A random Rare quality equipment item.

5% Chance: A random Epic quality equipment item.

11. Economic Balance & Monetization Philosophy
A. The Core Economic Loop
The economy is intentionally designed to be tight. For a mid-division team, the income from 8 home games per season will likely only slightly exceed the mandatory costs of player/staff salaries and maintenance. This creates a scenario where every credit counts. Profitability, and thus the ability to upgrade, is directly tied to:

Winning: Higher attendance and win streak bonuses are crucial for meaningful profit.

Smart Management: Choosing the right stadium upgrades and signing cost-effective player contracts.

B. Encouraging Gem Purchases (The "Pain Points")
This tight economy creates several "pain points" where a Gem purchase becomes an attractive option for an ambitious manager. The goal is not to force a purchase, but to make it feel like a powerful and worthwhile strategic choice.

Accelerating Upgrades: A manager might win a big tournament and have enough credits for a Level 3 Concession Stand, but they are 100,000 â‚¡ short of the Level 3 VIP Suites they really want. The temptation to purchase a Gem pack to bridge that gap and secure a massive long-term income boost will be very high.

The "Must-Have" Player: A legendary player appears on the marketplace, but their salary is enormous. The manager's budget is tight. Converting Gems to Credits provides the instant capital needed to sign that game-changing player that their free-to-play rival cannot afford this season.

Post-Game Recovery: After a tough, narrow victory, key players are exhausted. The manager has a championship match next. They are out of free consumables. The desire to spend a few Gems on a "Phoenix Elixir" to ensure the team is at 100% strength is a powerful, immediate emotional driver.

Avoiding the "Grind": A user who wants to compete at a high level but has less time to play can use Gems to buy entry tickets for tournaments they might have otherwise missed, effectively converting money into more opportunities for high-end rewards.

C. The Free-to-Play Path to Victory
Crucially, a skilled F2P player is not locked out. By winning consistently, playing all their free-entry tournaments, engaging with the ad rewards system, and making shrewd marketplace deals (buying low, selling high), they can build a top-tier team. It will take more time and strategic effort, but the path is clear. Gems provide speed and flexibility, not an insurmountable wall. This creates a healthy ecosystem where both spending and non-spending players feel their investment (time or money) is valued.
