Master Economy & Rewards
1. Guiding Principles
Clear Currency Roles: Credits (â‚¡) are the primary "Grind & Operate" currency earned through gameplay. Gems (ðŸ’Ž) are the premium "Convenience & Cosmetics" currency.
Balanced Loop: An average player's credit income should slightly exceed mandatory costs (salaries, maintenance), allowing for gradual progression and strategic spending.
Rewarding Success: Climbing divisions and winning championships provides the most significant rewards, creating a strong incentive for competitive play.
Fair Monetization ("Free-to-Play Friendly"): Core competitive advantages (i.e., stat-boosting items) must be accessible via Credits. Gems are for accelerating gameplay (e.g., extra entries) and purchasing exclusive cosmetic items (a future feature), not for buying exclusive power.
2. Currency & Starting Setup
Credits (â‚¡): Starting Amount: 50,000 Credits for new teams.
Gems (ðŸ’Ž): Starting Amount: 0 Gems for new teams.
Gem-to-Credit Exchange (Tiered System):
10 Gems => 4,500 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 450 Credits)
50 Gems => 25,000 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 500 Credits)
300 Gems => 165,000 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 550 Credits)
1000 Gems => 600,000 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 600 Credits)
3. Stadium & Financial Mechanics
This section details the core income and expenses that drive a team's economy.
A. Fan Attendance Algorithm
Attendance for home games is dynamic and crucial for income. It's calculated on a per-game basis.
Formula: Attendance = BaseCapacity * DivisionModifier * FanLoyaltyModifier * WinStreakModifier
Base Capacity: The current seat capacity of your stadium.
Division Modifier: Fans are more interested in higher-level play.
Div 1: 1.2x | Div 2: 1.1x | Div 3: 1.05x | Div 4: 1.0x | Div 5: 0.95x | Div 6: 0.9x | Div 7: 0.85x | Div 8: 0.8x
Fan Loyalty Modifier (0.75x to 1.25x): A persistent stat (0-100%) representing fan happiness. It increases with wins and stadium improvements (Lighting/Screens) and decays with losses or long periods of inactivity.
Win Streak Modifier (1.0x to 1.5x): A temporary boost for exciting play.
3-game streak: 1.1x | 5-game streak: 1.25x | 8+ game streak: 1.5x. Resets on loss.
B. Income Streams (Calculated Per Home Game Day)
Income Source
Calculation Formula
Notes
Ticket Sales
GameAttendance * 25 â‚¡
Your primary income driver.
Concessions
GameAttendance * 8 â‚¡ * ConcessionsLevel
Higher levels mean more options and more spending per fan.
Parking
(GameAttendance * 0.3) * 10 â‚¡ * ParkingLevel
Assumes 30% of attendees need parking.
VIP Suites
VIPSuitesLevel * 5000 â‚¡
High-margin, premium income. Independent of attendance.
Apparel Sales
GameAttendance * 3 â‚¡ * MerchandisingLevel
More fans means more jersey sales.
Sponsorships
(Future System)
Could be a flat daily rate based on division.

C. Expense Categories
Player & Staff Salaries: The largest fixed expense. Paid as a lump sum on Day 1 of each 17-day season. See Section 4 for details.
Facilities Maintenance: A daily fee of 0.2% of the total credits invested in all stadium upgrades.
Marketplace Listing Fee: 2% of a player's asking price, charged upon listing.
D. Stadium & Facility Upgrades
Upgrades are significant credit sinks that provide long-term income boosts. Costs scale exponentially.

4. Staff & Player Salaries (Paid Day 1)
Salaries are calculated based on skill and contract length. Longer contracts offer a discount but lock in the cost.
Player Salary Formula: (OverallSkill * 150 â‚¡) * ContractLengthModifier
1 Season Contract: 1.2x Modifier (High risk, high cost)
2 Season Contract: 1.0x Modifier (Standard)
3 Season Contract: 0.85x Modifier (Long-term investment discount)
Staff Salary Formulas (Skill 1-100):
Head Coach: 15,000 â‚¡ + (CoachSkill * 250 â‚¡). Required for team boosts.
Scout: 10,000 â‚¡ + (ScoutSkill * 150 â‚¡). Required for detailed player scouting.

9. Ad Rewards System
This system is designed to reward player engagement and provide a valuable resource stream for free-to-play users.
A. Core Mechanics
Daily Watch Limit: A user can watch a maximum of 10 rewarded ads per day. The limit resets daily at 3 AM EST.
Premium Box Milestone: A persistent counter tracks the total number of ads watched by the user. Every time this counter reaches 50, the user is awarded a Premium Box and the counter resets to 0.
B. Individual Ad Rewards
Each of the 10 daily ads provides a small, but useful, amount of Credits.
Reward Structure: Upon watching an ad, the user receives one of the following, chosen randomly:
70% Chance: 250 Credits
25% Chance: 500 Credits
5% Chance: 1,000 Credits
C. The Premium Box (Milestone Reward)
When opened, this box grants one reward from each of the following three categories:
Category 1: Currency (Guaranteed)
80% Chance: 10,000 Credits
15% Chance: 25,000 Credits
5% Chance: 10 Gems
Category 2: Consumables (Guaranteed)
60% Chance: 2x Advanced Recovery Serum
30% Chance: 2x Advanced Treatment
10% Chance: 1x Phoenix Elixir
Category 3: Equipment (Guaranteed)
75% Chance: A random Uncommon quality equipment item.
20% Chance: A random Rare quality equipment item.
5% Chance: A random Epic quality equipment item.
10. Economic Balance & Monetization Philosophy
A. The Core Economic Loop
The economy is intentionally designed to be tight. For a mid-division team, the income from 8 home games per season will likely only slightly exceed the mandatory costs of player/staff salaries and maintenance. This creates a scenario where every credit counts. Profitability, and thus the ability to upgrade, is directly tied to:
Winning: Higher attendance and win streak bonuses are crucial for meaningful profit.
Smart Management: Choosing the right stadium upgrades and signing cost-effective player contracts.
B. Encouraging Gem Purchases (The "Pain Points")
This tight economy creates several "pain points" where a Gem purchase becomes an attractive option for an ambitious manager. The goal is not to force a purchase, but to make it feel like a powerful and worthwhile strategic choice.
Accelerating Upgrades: A manager might win a big tournament and have enough credits for a Level 3 Concession Stand, but they are 100,000 â‚¡ short of the Level 3 VIP Suites they really want. The temptation to purchase a Gem pack to bridge that gap and secure a massive long-term income boost will be very high.
The "Must-Have" Player: A legendary player appears on the marketplace, but their salary is enormous. The manager's budget is tight. Converting Gems to Credits provides the instant capital needed to sign that game-changing player that their free-to-play rival cannot afford this season.
Post-Game Recovery: After a tough, narrow victory, key players are exhausted. The manager has a championship match next. They are out of free consumables. The desire to spend a few Gems on a "Phoenix Elixir" to ensure the team is at 100% strength is a powerful, immediate emotional driver.
Avoiding the "Grind": A user who wants to compete at a high level but has less time to play can use Gems to buy entry tickets for tournaments they might have otherwise missed, effectively converting money into more opportunities for high-end rewards.
C. The Free-to-Play Path to Victory
Crucially, a skilled F2P player is not locked out. By winning consistently, playing all their free-entry tournaments, engaging with the ad rewards system, and making shrewd marketplace deals (buying low, selling high), they can build a top-tier team. It will take more time and strategic effort, but the path is clear. Gems provide speed and flexibility, not an insurmountable wall. This creates a healthy ecosystem where both spending and non-spending players feel their investment (time or money) is valued.
