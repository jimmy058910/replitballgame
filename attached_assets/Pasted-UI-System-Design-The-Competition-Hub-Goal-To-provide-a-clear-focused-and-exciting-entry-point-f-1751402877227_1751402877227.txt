UI System Design: The Competition Hub
Goal: To provide a clear, focused, and exciting entry point for all on-field action. This hub is where users go when they want to play a match.
1. Top-Level Tabs
The Competition Hub is streamlined into three distinct game modes:
League
Tournaments
Exhibitions
2. Tab Content Breakdown
A. League Tab
Purpose: The central page for all official season-related activities. This is the most important tab for a user's seasonal progression.
Key Components:
Next Match Display: A prominent panel showing the user's next scheduled league opponent, their record, and the real-time countdown to the match simulation. This mirrors the Dashboard but is more focused.
League Standings: A full, scrollable table showing all teams in the user's current division and league. It must include: Rank, Team Name, W-L-T, PTS, DIFF (Point Differential), and Streak.
Full Schedule View: A toggle or button to view the team's complete 14-day league schedule, showing past results (with scores) and upcoming opponents.
Playoff Bracket (Visible on Day 15): On Playoff Day, this tab's view changes. The standings are replaced by a visual bracket showing the Top 4 teams and their matchups for the Semifinals and Championship.
B. Tournaments Tab
Purpose: A hub for optional, high-stakes competitive events.
Key Components:
Available Tournaments List: A list of tournaments the user is eligible for. Each entry should clearly display:
Tournament Name: (e.g., "Daily Diamond Cup," "Weekly Iron Grinder").
Entry Fee: Displayed in both Credits (â‚¡) and Gems (ðŸ’Ž).
Prize Pool: Clearly state the rewards for 1st, 2nd place, etc. (e.g., "1st: 20,000 â‚¡, 10 ðŸ’Ž").
Status: "Open for Registration," "In Progress," or "Completed."
Time Remaining: A countdown until registration closes or the tournament begins.
"Enter Tournament" Button: The primary call-to-action for each available tournament. Clicking it will deduct the entry fee.
My Active Tournaments: A separate section showing any tournaments the user is currently participating in, displaying their current match or their position in the bracket.
C. Exhibitions Tab
Purpose: The place for low-stakes, on-demand gameplay. Used for testing tactics, earning small rewards, or simply enjoying the simulation.
Key Components:
"Find Match" Button: The main call-to-action. Clicking this immediately starts a search for an available opponent for a single exhibition game.
Opponent Type Selector: Allow the user to choose their opponent:
Random User: Find another user of a similar Team Power level who is also searching for a match.
AI Team: Play against a computer-controlled team from your current division (useful if no human players are available).
Exhibition Entry Items: Clearly display how many "Exhibition Entry" items the user has in their inventory and a button to use one to play a match beyond their daily free limit.
