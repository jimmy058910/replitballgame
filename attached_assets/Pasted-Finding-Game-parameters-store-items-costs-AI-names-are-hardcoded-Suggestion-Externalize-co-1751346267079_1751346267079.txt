Please provide more information about your project (game engine, location of hardcoded parameters, preferred configuration method).

This is one of the suggestions given by you in a separate task. Can you walk through deciding and giving you the info needed?

Configuration Management:

Finding: Game parameters (store items, costs, AI names) are hardcoded.

Suggestion: Externalize configurations into JSON files, environment variables, or a dedicated config system.

Okay, I understand. To help you implement my previous suggestion, I need more details about your project. Please use the ls() and read_files() tools to show me where game parameters like store items, costs, or AI names are currently hardcoded. Also, let me know what game engine/framework you're using, and if you have a preferred method for externalizing these configurations (e.g., JSON files).

Are you able to find all of this on your own, using access to the full repo?

Yes, I can attempt to find this information myself by exploring the repository. Would you like me to start doing that?

Yes

Refactor: Externalize game configurations to JSON files

- Moved abilities definitions from shared/abilities.ts to shared/config/abilities.json.
- Moved race name definitions from shared/names.ts to shared/config/race_names.json.
- Created server/config/store_config.json to hold store item definitions, prices, currency conversion rates, and ad system parameters previously hardcoded or placeholder in server/routes/storeRoutes.ts.
- Updated corresponding TypeScript files to load data from these new JSON configuration files.
- Added fallbacks and improved error handling in some areas to gracefully handle missing or incomplete configuration data.

And is this implemented?

Implement player abilities, formation saving, and strategic substitutions

Implemented several enhancements to the match simulation and team management:

1.  **Player Ability Effects:**
    *   Integrated player abilities into `matchStateManager.ts`.
    *   Abilities like "Swift Feet," "Iron Grip," "Strong Arm," "Power Block,"
        and "Nimble Dodge" now have specific effects on match event outcomes.
    *   Event descriptions updated to reflect ability activations.

2.  **Tactical Formation Saving/Loading:**
    *   Enhanced the `/api/teams/my/formation` POST endpoint to correctly
        parse and save formation (player positions) and substitutionOrder
        as JSON strings in the `teams` table.
    *   Added a GET `/api/teams/my/formation` endpoint to retrieve and
        serve the saved tactical data to the client.

3.  **Strategic Substitutions:**
    *   Implemented stamina tracking for players within `matchStateManager.ts`.
    *   Players are automatically substituted based on low stamina and the
        pre-defined substitution order fetched at the start of a match.
    *   Added "substitution" and "fatigue" game events to provide feedback
        on these actions.
    *   Match simulation now uses active team rosters that change due
        to substitutions.

These changes provide a more dynamic and strategic match experience.
