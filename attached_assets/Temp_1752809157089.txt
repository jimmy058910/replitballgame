UI/UX Comprehensive Redesign Recommendations
Current UI/UX Issues Identified
1. Information Density Problems
Cognitive Overload: Too much information presented simultaneously
Inconsistent Hierarchies: Important information doesn't stand out from secondary details
Complex Navigation: Hub-based navigation has too many nested levels
2. Mobile-Unfriendly Patterns
Small Touch Targets: Many buttons and links are too small for mobile
Excessive Scrolling: Long forms and lists don't work well on mobile
Complex Tables: Data tables don't adapt well to narrow screens
UI/UX Redesign Strategy
1. Design System Implementation
Component Library: Create a comprehensive design system with mobile-first components

2. Navigation Redesign
Bottom Tab Navigation: Primary navigation should be bottom tabs for mobile
Breadcrumb System: Clear breadcrumbs for complex nested navigation
