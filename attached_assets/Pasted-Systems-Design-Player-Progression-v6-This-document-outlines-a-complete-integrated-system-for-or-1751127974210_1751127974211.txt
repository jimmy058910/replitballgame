Systems Design & Player Progression (v6)
This document outlines a complete, integrated system for organic player and staff progression, replacing a traditional XP/leveling system with a more dynamic, attribute-based development model. It eliminates individual training focus in favor of a more automated, staff-driven approach.

1. Player Progression System: Organic Growth
This system governs all aspects of how a player's stats change over time. Progression occurs in two phases: small, daily checks and a major end-of-season development event.

A. Revised Potential & Stat Cap System

The 1-5 star system is now a 10-point scale to accommodate half-stars (e.g., a rating of 7 represents 3.5 stars). The stat caps have been re-balanced to be less top-heavy.

Stat Cap Formula:
StatCap = 10 + (PotentialRating_out_of_10 * 3)

Example Stat Caps:

1 Star (Rating 2): Max stat of 16

2 Stars (Rating 4): Max stat of 22

3 Stars (Rating 6): Max stat of 28

4 Stars (Rating 8): Max stat of 34

5 Stars (Rating 10): Max stat of 40

B. Daily Progression Check (3 AM Reset)

A small, daily chance for a player to improve a single stat.

Logic: At the 3 AM daily reset, for each player on a team:

Calculate DailyProgressChance = BaseDailyChance + AgeModifier

BaseDailyChance = 1%

AgeModifier: +2% for Ages 18-23; 0% for Ages 24-30; -5% for Ages 31+.

If randf_range(0, 100) < DailyProgressChance, a single, random attribute that is not yet at its cap increases by +1.

C. End-of-Season Development (Day 17 Event)

This is the primary event where players see significant growth.

Logic: For each player, for each of their 8 core attributes, perform a Progression Check.

Progression Check Formula:
ProgressionChance = BaseChance + PotentialModifier + AgeModifier + UsageModifier + TrainerBonus

PotentialModifier (Revised): Based on the 10-point potential rating for that specific stat.

Rating 1-2 (1 star): +5% bonus chance

Rating 3-4 (2 stars): +10% bonus chance

Rating 5-6 (3 stars): +20% bonus chance

Rating 7-8 (4 stars): +30% bonus chance

Rating 9-10 (5 stars): +40% bonus chance

All other modifiers (BaseChance, AgeModifier, UsageModifier, TrainerBonus) remain the same as in v5.

D. Age-Related Decline

(No Change) The system for age-related decline (running at the end of the season for players 31+) remains an excellent core mechanic.

2. Staff System: Attributes & Progression
Staff are now dynamic entities with their own attributes that progress over time.

A. Staff Attributes (1-40 Scale)

Head Coach: Motivation, Tactics, Development

Trainers (Offense, Defense, Physical): Teaching, Specialization (e.g., how good the Offense Trainer is with Throwing vs. Catching)

Scouts (Head, Recruiting): Talent_Identification, Potential_Assessment

Recovery Specialist: Physiology, Rehabilitation

B. Staff Progression

Logic: At the end of each season, every staff member has a chance to increase a key attribute by +1. This chance is influenced by their age and team success.

StaffProgressChance = 10% + (TeamWinPercentage * 10) (A team that won 7 of 14 games (50%) gives a 10% + 5% = 15% chance).

Decline: Staff members over age 55 have a chance to see their stats decline each season.

C. Staff Effects (Backend Implementation)

Head Coach:

Motivation: Increases the BaseChance for all player progression checks. FinalBaseChance = BaseChance + (Motivation_Stat * 0.1%). (A coach with 30 Motivation provides a +3% boost).

Development: Directly influences the TrainerBonus provided by all other trainers. FinalTrainerBonus = BaseTrainerBonus * (1 + (Development_Stat / 100)). (A coach with 25 Development provides a +25% boost to the trainers' effectiveness).

Team Camaraderie (New): At the end of each season, increase a persistent team stat called camaraderie by HeadCoach.Leadership + (Years_on_Team). Camaraderie can provide small in-game bonuses, like a slightly higher chance for successful passes or better blocking coordination.

Trainers:

Effect: The TrainerBonus in the player progression formula is now derived from the trainer's Teaching attribute.

Formula: TrainerBonus = Teaching_Stat * 0.15%. (A trainer with a 30 Teaching stat provides a +4.5% bonus chance to their related attributes).

Recovery Specialist:

Effect: Boosts natural injury recovery rate.

Formula: total_recovery_points = base_daily_recovery + (Physiology_Stat * 1.5). (A specialist with 20 Physiology adds +30 RP per day to the base recovery).
