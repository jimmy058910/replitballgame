Game Economy & Rewards System (v2.1 - Detailed)
Goal: To design a balanced, scalable, and fair dual-currency economy. This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of all financial mechanics, including detailed revenue streams, expenses, and a rewarding seasonal league structure.
1. Guiding Principles
Clear Currency Roles: Credits (â‚¡) are the primary "Grind & Operate" currency. Gems (ðŸ’Ž) are the premium "Convenience & Cosmetics" currency.
Balanced Loop: An average player's credit income should slightly exceed mandatory costs, allowing for gradual progression.
Rewarding Success: Climbing divisions and winning championships provides the best rewards.
Fair Monetization ("Pay-for-Convenience, Not Power"): Core competitive advantages should not be exclusively locked behind a paywall. Gem purchases should save time or offer customization, not buy direct power.
2. Currency & Starting Setup
Credits (â‚¡):
Starting Amount: 50,000 Credits for new teams.
Gems (ðŸ’Ž):
Starting Amount: A randomized amount between 0 and 100 for new teams.
Gem-to-Credit Exchange:
10 Gems => 4,500 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 450 Credits)
50 Gems => 25,000 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 500 Credits)
300 Gems => 165,000 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 550 Credits)
1000 Gems => 600,000 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 600 Credits)
