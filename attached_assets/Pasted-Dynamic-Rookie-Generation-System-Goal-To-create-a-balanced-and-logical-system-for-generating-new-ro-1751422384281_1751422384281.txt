Dynamic Rookie Generation System
Goal: To create a balanced and logical system for generating new rookie players (ages 16-20) through the "Tryout" feature. This system ensures rookies start with appropriately low stats but have a clear, defined potential for future growth, with the quality of the recruits being directly influenced by the user's staff and investment.

1. Core Philosophy
Raw Talent, Not Finished Products: Rookies should be defined by their potential, not their immediate ability. Their starting stats must be low, reflecting their inexperience.

Meaningful Choice: An "Advanced Tryout" must provide a demonstrably better pool of talent than a "Basic Tryout" to justify its higher cost.

Staff Matters: A high-level Recruiting Scout should be a valuable asset that directly impacts the quality of incoming talent.

2. The Generation Algorithm (Step-by-Step)
When a user initiates a "Tryout," the system will follow these steps for each player generated:

Step 1: Determine Player Potential (The Star Rating)

First, determine the single, overall potential of the player. This is the most important factor.

Potential: A single rating from 1.0 to 5.0 stars (in 0.5 star increments).

Calculation: The potential is determined by a weighted random roll, influenced by the tryout type and the Recruiting Scout's level.

Tryout Type

Base Potential Distribution

Recruiting Scout Bonus

Basic

High chance of 1-2.5 stars, low chance of 3-4 stars, very rare chance of 4.5+.

Each level of the scout slightly increases the chance of rolling a higher-tier player.

Advanced

High chance of 2.5-4 stars, moderate chance of 4.5-5 stars.

Each level of the scout significantly increases the chance of rolling an elite (4.5+) star player.

Step 2: Determine Total Attribute Points (TAP) Pool

A rookie's starting stats are not random; they are allocated from a pool of points.

Calculation:
TAP = BasePoints + PotentialBonus

BasePoints: A low starting number.

Basic Tryout: randi_range(40, 60)

Advanced Tryout: randi_range(60, 85)

PotentialBonus: Higher potential players start with a slightly better foundation.

PotentialBonus = PlayerPotentialStars * 4 (e.g., a 4-star rookie gets +16 points to their starting pool).

Step 3: Distribute Attribute Points

The Total Attribute Points (TAP) are distributed among the 8 core stats, guided by the player's randomly assigned role.

Logic:

Assign a baseline minimum to every stat (e.g., 3 points each, for a total of 24).

Subtract these from the TAP pool.

Distribute the remaining points based on the player's role:

Passer: 60% of remaining points are distributed among Throwing, Agility, and Leadership. The other 40% are distributed among the rest.

Runner: 60% of remaining points are distributed among Speed, Agility, and Catching.

Blocker: 60% of remaining points are distributed among Power, Stamina, and Agility.

Apply racial modifiers after the initial distribution, clamping any stat at the maximum of 40.

Example Rookie Generation (Advanced Tryout):

Potential Roll: The system rolls and generates a 4.0-star potential player.

TAP Pool: BasePoints (rolls 75) + PotentialBonus (4.0 * 4 = 16) = 91 TAP.

Point Distribution:

Assign the base of 3 to each of the 8 stats (24 points used). 91 - 24 = 67 points remain.

The player is randomly assigned the "Runner" role.

~40 points (60% of 67) are randomly distributed among Speed, Agility, and Catching.

~27 points (40% of 67) are randomly distributed among the other 5 stats.

Final Result: A 17-year-old Runner with a 4.0-star potential and starting stats that might look like:

Speed: 16, Agility: 18, Catching: 15, Power: 8, Throwing: 5, etc.

This player is clearly a project with a high ceiling but is not ready to be an immediate star.

4. UI & Visual Representation
This addresses the feedback on the card displays.

Roster Card: Must display the single, overall Potential star rating clearly.

Full Player Card Pop-up:

REMOVE the individual potential bars next to each stat.

ADD the single, overall Potential star rating in a prominent position.

Scouting Effect: The star rating should be displayed as a range (e.g., "3.0 - 4.5 Stars") if the user's Head Scout level is low. A high-level scout reveals the precise rating (e.g., "4.0 Stars"). This makes scouting a valuable investment.

This revamped system ensures that your Tryout feature generates players that are balanced, fit the "raw talent" archetype, and make the user's investment in better scouts feel meaningful and rewarding.
