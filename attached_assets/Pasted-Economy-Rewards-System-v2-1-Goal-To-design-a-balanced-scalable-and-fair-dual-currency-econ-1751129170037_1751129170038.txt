Economy & Rewards System (v2.1)

Goal: To design a balanced, scalable, and fair dual-currency economy based on the detailed financial mechanics provided. The system must feel rewarding for both free-to-play and paying users, with a clear separation between operational/progression currency (Credits) and convenience/cosmetic currency (Gems).

1. Guiding Principles
Currency Roles: Credits (â‚¡) are the primary "Grind & Operate" currency. Gems (ðŸ’Ž) are the premium "Convenience & Cosmetics" currency.

Balanced Loop: An average player's credit income should slightly exceed mandatory costs, allowing for gradual progression.

Rewarding Success: Climbing divisions and winning championships must provide the best rewards.

Fair Monetization: Core competitive advantages should not be exclusively locked behind a paywall. Gem purchases should allow players to save time, express themselves, or play more often, but not buy a direct, otherwise unattainable, advantage.

2. Currency & Starting Setup
Credits (â‚¡):

Starting Amount: 50,000 Credits for new teams.

Usage: All major operational costs and standard progression.

Gems (ðŸ’Ž):

Starting Amount: A randomized amount between 0 and 100 for new teams.

Usage: Premium convenience, extra play, and cosmetics.

Gem-to-Credit Exchange: Provides a way to convert Gems to Credits as a convenience or catch-up mechanic. The Replit AI document mentioned a ~10:1 ratio, which is too low and would devalue Credits earned from playing. We will use a more balanced, tiered system to make the exchange meaningful but not overpowering:

10 Gems => 4,500 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 450 Credits)

50 Gems => 25,000 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 500 Credits) - Value Anchor: Enough for one "Basic Tryout."

300 Gems => 165,000 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 550 Credits) - Value Anchor: Enough for one "Advanced Tryout."

1000 Gems => 600,000 Credits (Ratio: 1 Gem = 600 Credits) - Value Anchor: A major boost, but less than a top division championship prize.

3. Team Income & Expenses

Revenue from jersey/merch sales.

Sponsorships

(Future System) Could be a flat daily rate based on division.

To be designed.

B. Expense Categories

Player Salaries: Paid on Day 1 of each 17-day season.

Staff Salaries: Paid on Day 1 of each 17-day season.

Facilities Maintenance: A small, daily credit fee automatically deducted (e.g., 0.5% of the total cost of all stadium upgrades).

5. Store, Items & Entry Fees
Balanced Approach to "Premium Only" Items: To maintain a fair-to-play environment, items providing a direct statistical advantage should always have a Credit-based acquisition path, even if it's expensive. Items marked as "Premium Only" in the source document will be either purely cosmetic or have a very high Credit alternative.

6. League & Tournament Rewards System
This is the primary driver for seasonal competition. Rewards must scale dramatically with division to create aspiration. The "Playoff Champion" gets the biggest prize.

This revamped economy provides a clear gameplay loop: Play League Games -> Earn Credits -> Use Credits to Pay Costs & Improve Team -> Compete in Tournaments for Bigger Prizes -> Win Playoffs -> Get Promoted -> Face Higher Costs but Earn Higher Rewards.
