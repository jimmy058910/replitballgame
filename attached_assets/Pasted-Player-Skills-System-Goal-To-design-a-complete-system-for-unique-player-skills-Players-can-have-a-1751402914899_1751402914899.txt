Player Skills System
Goal: To design a complete system for unique player skills. Players can have a limited number of skills, which are acquired and upgraded through gameplay progression over time. This system adds a layer of specialization and uniqueness to each player, making team management more dynamic and rewarding.
1. Core Concepts
Skill Limit: A player can have a maximum of 3 active skills at any given time.
Acquisition: Skills are not directly purchased. They are acquired semi-randomly at key progression points (e.g., at the end of a season, upon reaching an age milestone, or through rare training outcomes).
Upgrades: If a player would acquire a skill they already possess, the skill is upgraded to the next tier, enhancing its effect. This is the primary way skills become more powerful.
Leadership Influence: A player's Leadership attribute directly influences the chance of acquiring a new skill or upgrading an existing one. Higher leadership means more frequent progression opportunities.
Rarity/Tiers: Skills have rarity tiers that correspond to their power level. Upgrading a skill moves it up one tier.
2. Skill Tiers & Types
Skill Tiers (Rarity): | Tier | Name | Notes | | :--- | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------- | | 1 | Common (I) | The base version of a skill. | | 2 | Uncommon (II) | A noticeable improvement. | | 3 | Rare (III) | A powerful and significant boost. | | 4 | Epic (IV) | A game-changing level of power. |
Skill Types:
Passive: The effect is always active (e.g., a flat stat boost).
Active: The effect has a chance to trigger during a specific in-game event (e.g., on a tackle attempt).
3. Database & System Logic
A. Database Tables:
Skills (Master Skill List) | Column Name | Data Type | Description | Example | | :------------ | :-------- | :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | | skill_id | INTEGER (PK) | Unique ID for the skill template. | 101 | | name | TEXT | The display name of the skill. | "Second Wind" | | description | TEXT | What the skill does. | "Grants a burst of stamina when fatigued." | | type | TEXT | "Passive" or "Active". | "Passive" | | category | TEXT | "Universal", "Role", or "Race". | "Universal" |
Player_Skills (Join Table) | Column Name | Data Type | Description | Example | | :------------ | :-------- | :---------------------------------------- | :--------- | | player_skill_id | INTEGER (PK) | Unique ID for this specific player-skill link. | 5001 | | player_id | INTEGER (FK) | The ID of the player who has the skill. | 15 | | skill_id | INTEGER (FK) | The ID of the skill they have learned. | 101 | | current_tier | INTEGER | The current level of the skill (1-4). | 2 (Tier II) |
B. Skill Acquisition & Upgrade Logic (Example for End of Season):
At the end of each season (Day 17), iterate through every player on the user's team.
For each player, calculate their "Skill-Up Chance": chance = BASE_CHANCE + (player.leadership * LEADERSHIP_MODIFIER) (e.g., BASE_CHANCE = 5%, LEADERSHIP_MODIFIER = 0.25%).
Roll a die (e.g., 1-100). If the roll is less than chance, the player gets a skill-up event.
If Skill-Up Event Occurs:
If the player has fewer than 3 skills, they learn a new, random, Tier 1 skill they are eligible for (based on their Race and Role).
If the player already has 3 skills, one of their existing skills is randomly chosen and upgraded by one tier (up to the max of Tier 4).
