Implementation Plan for Full Player Card Revamp
Goal: To provide clear, actionable instructions for updating the detailed Player Card pop-up to align with the latest game design decisions. This involves consolidating tabs, changing how stats are displayed, and removing obsolete systems.

1. Required Changes to Tab Structure
The current six tabs (Stats, Abilities, Equipment, Contract, Awards, Scouting) must be consolidated into four tabs.

Stats + Contract + Scouting => Overview (New Default Tab): These three tabs must be merged into a single, comprehensive "Overview" tab. This will be the first tab a user sees.

Abilities => Abilities & Skills: This tab remains but should be renamed for clarity.

Equipment => Equipment: This tab remains.

Awards => Game Logs & Awards: This tab will now contain two sub-sections for a player's awards and their recent game-by-game statistics.

2. Detailed Implementation for the "Overview" Tab
This is the most significant change. The new "Overview" tab must be built with the following components, replacing the old content from the Stats, Contract, and Scouting tabs:

A. Core Attributes Section:

REMOVE Dual-Bar System: The current system showing two bars (blue and brownish-yellow) for each stat must be completely removed.

IMPLEMENT Single Bar System: Replace it with a single progress bar for each of the 8 attributes.

IMPLEMENT Text Label: The text for each stat must display the current value out of the potential-defined maximum (e.g., Speed: 27/38).

IMPLEMENT Stat Color-Coding: The numerical value (27 in the example) must be color-coded based on its value (Red: 1-15, White: 16-25, Green: 26-34, Blue: 35-40).

B. Potential & Scouting Section:

REMOVE Individual Potential Bars: The brownish-yellow potential bars next to each stat must be removed.

IMPLEMENT Single Potential Rating: Add a new, prominent section that displays a single "Potential" rating for the player.

IMPLEMENT Star System: This rating must be displayed using a 0 to 5-star system, including half-stars.

IMPLEMENT Scouting Logic: The accuracy of the star rating must be tied to the user's Head Scout level. A low-level scout should show a range (e.g., "Potential: 2.5 - 4.0 Stars"), while a high-level scout shows a precise rating ("Potential: 3.5 Stars").

C. Contract & Camaraderie Section:

MOVE FROM OLD TAB: The Current Salary and Contract Status information must be moved from the old Contract tab to this section.

REMOVE Team Camaraderie: The "Team Camaraderie" bar must be removed from this individual player card. It is a team-level stat.

IMPLEMENT Player Camaraderie: It should be replaced with a bar for "Player Camaraderie," showing the individual player's morale/happiness score (e.g., 50/100).

IMPLEMENT Negotiate Contract Button: A prominent button must be present in this section. It should be active and clickable only when the player is in the final year of their contract.

3. Removal of Obsolete Systems
REMOVE "Training Focus": The user has decided to simplify the game and remove micromanagement. Any UI elements, backend logic, or database fields related to a "Training Focus" system must be completely removed from the game. Players will now progress organically based on the new systems.
