Refinements & Enhancements for the Camaraderie System
Hereâ€™s how we can add more detail to each effect, making them more dynamic and impactful:

1. In-Game Performance (The "Clutch Time" Effect)

Instead of a single bonus for being ">75", let's make it tiered to reward teams for achieving higher levels of cohesion. This also applies penalties for low camaraderie.

Excellent (91-100): "+2" to Catching & Agility. Passers have a significant accuracy boost.

Good (76-90): "+1" to Catching & Agility. Passers have a minor accuracy boost.

Low (26-40): "-1" to Catching & Agility. Passers have a minor accuracy penalty.

Poor (0-25): "-2" to Catching & Agility. Passers have a significant accuracy penalty, and there's a small chance for a "miscommunication" fumble on handoffs.

2. Player Development (The "Mentorship" Effect)

Let's quantify exactly how camaraderie helps young players develop.

Suggestion: During the End-of-Season Progression phase, the team's camaraderie provides a direct bonus to the ProgressionChance for all players aged 23 and under.

Formula: ProgressionChance += (TeamCamaraderie - 50) * 0.1

Example: A team with "Excellent" camaraderie (e.g., 90) would give its young players a (90 - 50) * 0.1 = +4% chance to improve each stat, making a huge difference in their development speed. A team with "Poor" camaraderie (e.g., 20) would give a -3% penalty, stunting growth.

3. Contract Negotiations (The "Happy Locker Room" Effect)

We can directly link camaraderie to the Willingness to Sign score we designed previously.

Suggestion: When a player enters contract negotiations, their individual camaraderie score directly influences their willingness to accept an offer.

Formula: WillingnessToSign_Score += (player.camaraderie - 50) * 0.2

Example: A player with high camaraderie (90) gets a +8 bonus to their willingness score, making them much more likely to accept a team-friendly deal. A player with low camaraderie (20) gets a -6 penalty, making them demand more money or leave.

4. Injury Prevention (The "Look Out for Each Other" Effect)

Let's make this a tiered bonus as well.

Suggestion: High team camaraderie reduces the base chance of injury for all players during a match.

Effect:

Excellent (91-100): -3% to base injury chance.

Good (76-90): -1.5% to base injury chance.
