Promotion & Relegation Algorithm
Guiding Principles
This version refines the algorithm to create a more robust competitive pyramid, enhancing the player journey from the lowest tiers to the pinnacle of Division 1.
Performance-Based: Success remains directly tied to regular season rank and tournament victories.
Enhanced Scalability: The system is now better equipped to handle a massive player base by increasing upward mobility from the lower tiers.
Elite & Exclusive Top Tier: Division 1 is strictly maintained at 16 teams. Division 2 is expanded to a 48-team (3x16) "Gateway Tier," making it a significant achievement to reach and a true test of skill to advance from.
Dual Pathways to Promotion: The system continues to reward both season-long consistency and clutch tournament performance.
The Algorithm: A Top-Down Process
The process runs automatically on Game Day 17 after AI teams are purged. The core logic remains top-down, but the flow between divisions has been adjusted to accommodate the new structure.
Step 1: Division 1 Relegation (The Great Filter)
This step is unchanged and ensures a stable flow of 6 teams into Division 1 each season.
Rule: The teams that finish in 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th place in the Division 1 final regular-season standings are automatically relegated to Division 2.
Outcome: 6 empty slots are created in Division 1.
Step 2: Division 2 Promotion (The Ascent)
This step fills the 6 empty slots in Division 1 from the newly expanded Division 2.
Division 2 Structure: Division 2 now consists of 3 parallel sub-divisions of 16 teams each (48 teams total).
Rule: From each of the 3 sub-divisions, 2 teams are promoted:
The Season Champion: The team that finishes #1 in the regular-season standings.
The Tournament Champion: The winner of that sub-division's tournament.
Dominance Clause (The "Roll-Down"): If the same team is both the Season Champion and the Tournament Champion, the second promotion slot is awarded to the next-highest-ranked team in the regular-season standings (the #2 ranked team).
Outcome: Exactly 6 teams are promoted from Division 2 to Division 1.
Step 3: Division 2 Relegation & Division 3 Promotion (The Churn)
This is the most significant change, doubling the flow of teams between the lower and upper tiers.
Division 2 Relegation:
Rule: With larger 16-team sub-divisions, the bottom 4 teams (13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th place) in each of the 3 Division 2 sub-divisions are relegated to Division 3.
Outcome: A total of 12 teams (4 teams x 3 sub-divisions) are relegated from Division 2, creating 12 open slots.
Division 3 Promotion (The Promotion Pool):
To fill the 12 new openings in Division 2, a "Promotion Pool" is created from all Division 3 sub-divisions.
Pool Entry: From every Division 3 sub-division, the Season Champion (#1 rank) and the Tournament Winner are entered into the pool.
Ranking: Teams in the Promotion Pool are ranked server-wide based on Regular Season Win Percentage, with point differential as the tiebreaker.
Rule: The Top 12 ranked teams from this Promotion Pool are promoted to Division 2.
Step 4: Standardized Cascade (Divisions 3 through 8)
This logic is now standardized for all lower tiers, assuming they are also structured as 16-team sub-divisions.
Relegation (from D3, D4, D5, D6, D7): The bottom 4 teams from each sub-division are relegated to the division below. The total number of relegated teams will be (Number of sub-divisions at that tier) x 4.
Promotion (from D4, D5, D6, D7, D8): The "Promotion Pool" system is used. The top X teams from the pool are promoted, where X is the number of open slots created by the relegations from the division above (X = Num sub-divisions * 4).
Example: If Division 3 has 20 sub-divisions, it will relegate 80 teams (20 x 4). Therefore, the Top 80 teams from the Division 4 Promotion Pool will be promoted to Division 3.
Step 5: The Foundation (Division 8 and Below)
Promotion: The Promotion Pool system is used to promote the top teams to Division 7.
No Relegation: Teams cannot be relegated from the lowest tier.
