Market & Store Hub UI/UX Revamp
Goal: To redesign and implement the full functionality of the Market Hub, addressing critical UI bugs, missing features, and data inconsistencies to create a clear, functional, and visually appealing economic center for the game.

1. General Market Hub Fixes
This section addresses the top-level issues on the main Market Hub page.

A. Header Readability:

Issue: The main "Market Hub" title and its description are dark text on a dark background, making them very difficult to read.

Action: Change the text color for the "Market Hub" title and the "All transactions..." subtitle to a high-contrast color, such as white or a light grey, to ensure they are clearly legible.

B. Currency Display Synchronization:

Issue: The "Credits" and "Gems" display within the "Enhanced Game Economy" component shows 0, which does not match the user's actual currency totals shown in the main navigation bar at the top of the screen.

Action: This component must be correctly bound to the user's primary currency data. It should always display the exact same Credit and Gem values that are shown in the main navigation bar.

C. Key Metrics Panel Revamp:

Issue: The "Total Stadium Revenue" text is invisible (white on white). The four separate metric boxes (Total Credits, Premium Gems, Stadium Revenue, Net Revenue) are plain and don't stand out.

Action: Replace the four individual boxes with a single, unified "Financial Summary" panel. This panel should have a distinct style, such as the purple gradient you suggested, to make it a focal point. It should clearly display all four key metrics with proper labels and formatting to ensure readability.

2. Store Tab Implementation
The "Store" tab needs to be built out with its intended features: a rotating selection of items for both premium and standard currency.

A. New Sub-Tab Structure:

The Store section should have two clear sub-tabs: Featured Items and Credit Store.

B. Featured Items (Premium Store):

Issue: This section is currently empty.

Action: This tab must feature a daily rotating stock of 4-6 items. These items should be primarily of Rare, Epic, or Legendary quality.

Pricing: As per our "Balanced v2" economy, these items should be purchasable with Gems, but also have a very high Credit alternative to ensure they are not strictly "pay-to-win."

C. Credit Store (New Feature):

Issue: There is currently no dedicated store for spending the primary game currency on items.

Action: Create the "Credit Store" sub-tab. This tab must feature a daily rotating stock of 6-8 items. These items should be of Common and Uncommon quality and should be purchasable only with Credits. This gives all players a reliable way to acquire basic gear and consumables.

3. Division Rewards & Currency Exchange Tabs
These tabs need to be populated with the correct information and have their UI fixed.

A. Division Rewards Tab:

Issue: The page is currently blank.

Action: This tab must be populated with the full 8-division rewards table we designed. It should clearly display the Credit and Gem prizes for the Playoff Champion, Playoff Runner-Up, and Regular Season Winner for each division, from Diamond down to Stone.

B. Currency Exchange Tab:

Issue: The text in the "Exchange Information" section is impossible to read (white text on a light grey background).

Action: The background color of the "Exchange Information" boxes must be changed to a darker color to provide sufficient contrast for the white text. Additionally, ensure the tiered exchange rates we designed are correctly implemented and displayed.

This detailed plan addresses every issue you raised and provides a clear path to creating a functional, balanced, and visually appealing Market Hub.
