Project Brief: Team Inventory UI & UX Revamp
Goal: To redesign the /team > Inventory tab, consolidating the confusing multi-tab layout into a single, intuitive, and functional hub. This new design provides a clear overview of all owned assets and simplifies the process of using and activating items.

1. Core Design Philosophy
Unified View: The primary Equipment & Items and Consumables tabs are REMOVED. All items will be displayed on a single page, managed by a clear filtering system.

Action-Oriented Design: The confusing "Activate for Matches" sub-tab is eliminated. Activating a single-game boost will be done directly from the item itself.

Clarity and Consistency: The layout will be inspired by the effective design of the Exhibitions page, using clear cards and panels to present information logically.

2. Proposed Inventory Hub Layout
The new single-page layout will be organized into three distinct sections:

Filter Bar: To easily sort through different item types.

Item Grid: The main display showing all owned items.

Active Boosts Panel: A dedicated area to see which single-game boosts are queued for the next match.

3. Detailed Component Breakdown
A. Filter Bar
This replaces the top-level tabs and allows the user to easily view their assets.

UI: A row of toggle buttons at the top of the page.

Buttons:

All Items (Default view)

Equipment (Helmets, Armor, Gloves, Footwear)

Consumables (Recovery & Booster items)

Game Entries (Exhibition & Tournament entry items)

Trophies (Mid-Season Classic & League Championship trophies)

B. Item Grid
This is the main content area, displaying all items the user owns based on the selected filter.

UI: A responsive grid of item cards.

Item Card Content: Each card should clearly display:

The item's icon.

The item's name (e.g., "Advanced Recovery Serum").

The quantity owned (e.g., "x3").

The item's rarity, indicated by a colored border (Grey, Green, Blue, Purple, Gold).

Interaction: Clicking on any item card opens a detailed pop-up.

C. Item Interaction Pop-up
When an item card is clicked, a pop-up appears with details and a context-sensitive action button.

For Equipment (e.g., "Gryllstone Plated Helm"):

Details: Shows description, stat bonuses, and any race restrictions.

Action Button: [ Equip on Player ] - This would open a list of eligible players on the roster to equip the item to.

For Recovery Consumables (e.g., "Basic Medical Kit"):

Details: Shows description ("Instantly heals 25 Injury Recovery Points").

Action Button: [ Use on Player ] - This would open a list of injured players, allowing the user to apply the item immediately.

For Single-Game Boosters (e.g., "Speed Boost Tonic"):

Details: Shows description ("+3 Speed for one league match").

Action Button: [ Activate for Next League Match ] - Clicking this adds the boost to the "Active Boosts" panel and consumes one of the three available slots for that match.

D. Active Boosts Panel (NEW)
This dedicated panel solves the problem of not knowing which boosts are active.

UI: A small, distinct panel, perhaps on the right side of the screen.

Title: Next Match Boosts (1/3) - The title dynamically updates to show how many of the 3 available slots are filled.

Content: Displays a simple list of the boosts the user has activated for their next league game.

Example Entry: Speed Boost Tonic on Player 5 (+3 Speed)

Functionality: Each entry should have a small (x) button to allow the user to cancel an activated boost, which would return the item to their inventory and free up the slot.

This revamped design makes the inventory system significantly more user-friendly, logically organizes all assets, and provides clear, intuitive ways for players to interact with their items.
