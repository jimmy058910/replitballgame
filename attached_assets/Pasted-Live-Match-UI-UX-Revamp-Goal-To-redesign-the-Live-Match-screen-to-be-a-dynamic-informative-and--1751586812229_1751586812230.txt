Live Match UI & UX Revamp
Goal: To redesign the Live Match screen to be a dynamic, informative, and strategically relevant hub for the user. This revamp will surface key game mechanics like fan atmosphere, team tactics, and player performance, providing a clear narrative of the game as it unfolds.

1. Core Design Philosophy
From Scoreboard to Command Center: The UI should give the user the feeling that they are watching the game from a tactical overview, not just reading a log.

Surface Key Mechanics: The user's choices regarding stadium upgrades, fan loyalty, and team tactics must be visually represented on this screen to show their impact.

Tell a Story: The UI should help tell the story of the match by highlighting momentum, key player performances, and the current game phase.

2. Proposed Live Match Screen Layout
The screen will be reorganized into more distinct and purposeful information panels.

(This is a conceptual layout to guide the design)

3. Detailed Component Breakdown
A. Scoreboard & Possession Panel (Top-Left)
Content:

Team Names & Score: Oakland Cougars [ 0 - 0 ] Stone Lions

Possession Indicator: A small, glowing ball icon should appear next to the name of the team that currently has possession. This is a critical piece of information for a non-stop game.

Reasoning: This keeps the most vital information—who's winning and who has the ball—clear and prominent.

B. Game Clock & Phase Panel (Top-Center)
Content:

Game Clock: 00:00 - The running game clock.

Half Indicator: Half 1

Dynamic Game Phase: The "early" tag is replaced with a more descriptive phase that updates based on the game clock.

Early Game (First 25% of the half)

Mid Game (25% - 75% of the half)

Late Game (75% - 90% of the half)

Clutch Time! (Final 10% of the half) - This tag should be visually distinct (e.g., flash or have a different color) to increase tension.

Reasoning: Using dynamic phases helps build a narrative arc for the match and provides context for the AI's situational tactics.

C. Atmosphere & Crowd Panel (Top-Right) - Revamped
Issue: "Crowd: 80%" and "Intimidation: 40" are abstract.

Revamped Content:

Title: Home Field Advantage

Attendance: Fans: 12,000 / 15,000 (80%) - Shows both the actual number of fans and the percentage, directly answering your request.

Fan Loyalty: Loyalty: 78% - Displays the underlying stat that drives atmosphere.

Away Team Effect: Effect: -3 to Opponent Catching & Throwing - This translates the "Intimidation Factor" into a clear, understandable gameplay consequence for the user.

Reasoning: This makes the stadium and fan management systems feel impactful by showing the user the direct result of their investment on the field.

D. Tactics & Camaraderie Panel (NEW)
Goal: To surface the crucial strategic and morale systems.

Visual: A new panel below the main three.

Content:

Team Tactic: Your Tactic: Balanced

Opponent Tactic: Opponent Tactic: All-Out Attack

Team Camaraderie: Camaraderie: In Sync! (92) - Displays both the descriptive tier and the numerical score.

Reasoning: This allows the user to see how their chosen strategy matches up against their opponent's and provides immediate context for why their team might be performing well (or poorly) in "Clutch Time."

E. Enhanced Play-by-Play Commentary
(No Change to Layout) The layout is good.

Content: The commentary engine should be populated with the detailed prompts from the live_commentary_system_v4 document, ensuring it calls out player skills, injuries, fatigue, and tactical situations.

F. Key Performers Panel (NEW)
Goal: To highlight standout players and tell a story within the game.

Visual: A small panel, perhaps on the side, that dynamically updates throughout the match.

Content:

Your Team's MVP: Shows the portrait, name, and a key stat of your best-performing player so far (e.g., Player 5: 85 Rushing Yards).

Opponent's MVP: Shows the same for the opponent's best player (e.g., Player 9: 4 Tackles, 1 Knockdown).

Reasoning: This makes individual player performances more visible and engaging, adding another layer to the game's narrative.

This revamped design transforms the Live Match screen into a rich, informative dashboard that truly reflects the depth of the game's underlying systems.
