2. **In Memoria**: Check established validation patterns
3. **Serena**: `replace_symbol_body` for precise edits
4. **Serena**: `find_referencing_symbols` for impact analysis

#### **üèóÔ∏è Feature Development Mode**
```
"Add new tournament bracket system"
```

**Optimal Tool Chain:**
1. **In Memoria**: Analyze existing tournament patterns
2. **Serena**: `get_symbols_overview` of tournament-related files
3. **Serena**: Symbol-level implementation with pattern consistency
4. **Playwright**: UI testing of new tournament features

#### **üé® UI/UX Validation Mode**
```
/design-review
```

**Comprehensive Design Validation:**
1. **Playwright**: Multi-viewport testing
2. **In Memoria**: UI pattern consistency checking
3. **Accessibility compliance** (WCAG AA)
4. **Screenshot evidence** with prioritized feedback

### **Phase 4: End Session Cleanup**
```
/dev-stop
```

**Intelligent Shutdown:**
- Clean service termination
- In Memoria pattern persistence
- Serena project state saving
- Development progress summary

## üß† INTELLIGENT QUERY PATTERNS

### **When to Use Each Tool**

#### **Use Serena For:**
```bash
# Find specific functions/classes
"Find all authentication middleware functions"
"Show me the UserProfile class definition"
"Where is the credit validation logic?"

# Precise symbol-level edits
"Update the calculateTeamStats function"
"Add error handling to the matchService"
"Refactor the PlayerCard component"
```

#### **Use In Memoria For:**
```bash
# Pattern understanding
"What coding patterns do we use for error handling?"
"Show me our established React component structure"
"What's our consistent approach to API validation?"

# Domain context
"What Dome Ball concepts are in the codebase?"
"How do we handle team management patterns?"
```

#### **Use Both Together:**
```bash
# Complex development tasks
"Implement credit transaction logging following our established patterns"
# 1. In Memoria: Check logging patterns
# 2. Serena: Find existing credit functions
# 3. Serena: Implement with pattern consistency
```

## üéØ ADVANCED WORKFLOW PATTERNS

### **Pattern 1: Bug Investigation**
```
User reports: "Team standings are incorrect after matches"

Intelligent Approach:
1. Serena: `find_symbol` for standings calculation
2. Serena: `find_referencing_symbols` to trace data flow
3. In Memoria: Check calculation patterns for consistency
4. Serena: Identify and fix the specific symbol
5. Playwright: Test the fix across different scenarios
```

### **Pattern 2: Feature Enhancement**
```
Request: "Add player trade history to roster page"

Intelligent Approach:
1. In Memoria: Analyze existing trade/history patterns
2. Serena: Find roster page components
3. Serena: Locate trade-related data models
4. Implement using established patterns
5. Playwright: Test new UI components
```

### **Pattern 3: Code Refactoring**
```
Goal: "Refactor authentication system for better maintainability"

Intelligent Approach:
1. Serena: `get_symbols_overview` of auth files
2. In Memoria: Check auth patterns across codebase
3. Serena: `find_referencing_symbols` for impact analysis
4. Plan refactoring with pattern consistency
5. Serena: Execute precise symbol-level changes
```

## üìà PRODUCTIVITY MULTIPLIERS
