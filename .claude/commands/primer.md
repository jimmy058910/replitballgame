# Prime Context for Claude Code

Use the command 'tree' to get an understanding of the project structure

Start with reading the CLAUDE.md file, as well as the REALM_RIVALRY_COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md, and lastly the SESSION_LOG.md to see what we last worked on

These will give you a great primer for a new session to gain a large understanding of the project quickly

IMPORTANT: Use Serena to search through the codebase. If you get any errors using Serena, retry with Serena tools.
