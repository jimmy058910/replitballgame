This directory contains Claude Code configuration and workspace files.

## 📂 Current Contents

### **Configuration**
- `settings.local.json` - Claude Code local settings and preferences

## 🗂️ **Archived Items (September 9, 2025)**

The following TypeScript migration systems have been archived to `archive/typescript-migration-attempts/`:

### **v2.0 Agent System** (`agents/`)
- Complete AI agent architecture with specialized fixing agents
- 7 iterations of migration attempts and learning
- Analysis results, iteration reports, and coordination systems

### **v3.0 Deterministic System** (`typescript-v3/`)
- Ground-up rebuild with deterministic fixes and validation
- 4-layer architecture: foundation, fixes, validation, orchestration
- Complete migration guide and canonical type definitions

## 📋 **Archive Reason**

After extensive experimentation with automated TypeScript migration (v1.0 manual, v2.0 agents, v3.0 deterministic), the decision was made to:

1. **Accept relaxed TypeScript configuration** for development velocity
2. **Focus on feature development** for pre-Alpha launch
3. **Archive migration attempts** to avoid future confusion
4. **Implement gradual typing** strategy post-launch

## 🎯 **Current Strategy**

- ✅ **Relaxed TypeScript** - Focus on development, not perfect types
- ✅ **Feature-first approach** - Ship working game features
- ✅ **Technical debt management** - Address incrementally post-launch
- ✅ **Practical development** - Solo developer optimized workflow

**Cleanup Date**: September 9, 2025  
**Reason**: Strategic pivot from automated migration to practical development approach  
**Status**: TypeScript migration work archived, development focus restored
