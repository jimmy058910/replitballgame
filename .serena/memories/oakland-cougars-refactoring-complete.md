- Greek alphabet subdivision support

### 2.3 Enhanced Development Routes ✅
**New Endpoints Added**:
- `GET /api/dev/auth-info` - Authentication documentation
- `GET /api/dev/validate-token` - Token validation
- `GET /api/dev/oakland-status` - Oakland Cougars status
- `POST /api/dev/seed-teams` - Team creation
- `POST /api/dev/seed-complete` - Complete environment setup

## Phase 3: Emergency Endpoint Security - ✅ COMPLETED

### 3.1 Emergency Endpoint Analysis ✅
**Categorized 11 emergency endpoints** from leagueRoutes.ts:
- **4 HIGH RISK**: Production hotfixes requiring immediate security
- **3 MEDIUM RISK**: Administrative tools needing proper auth  
- **2 LOW RISK**: Development utilities to be moved
- **2 LEGITIMATE**: Core features to be improved

### 3.2 Admin Authentication System ✅
**Location**: `server/services/admin/adminAuthService.ts`
**Features**:
- Permission-based access control
- Emergency and superuser token levels
- Confirmation middleware for destructive operations
- Comprehensive audit logging
- IP address and user agent tracking

### 3.3 Emergency Routes Extraction ✅
**Location**: `server/routes/admin/emergencyRoutes.ts`
**Secured Endpoints**:
- `POST /admin/emergency/fix-team-contracts/:teamId` - Protected with emergency_fixes permission
- `POST /admin/emergency/fix-team-players/:teamId` - Protected with emergency_fixes permission  
- `POST /admin/emergency/move-team-subdivision` - Protected with team_management permission
- `POST /admin/emergency/reset-division-subdivision` - Protected with data_deletion permission + confirmation

## Technical Achievements

### ✅ Zero Hardcoded References
- Eliminated all hardcoded 'Oakland Cougars' string matching from core services
- Removed special case handling from UserSubdivisionService
- Extracted team-specific logic to dedicated services

### ✅ Proper Separation of Concerns

### ✅ Security Implementation
- All development endpoints require proper authentication
- Emergency operations require admin tokens with specific permissions
- Destructive operations require explicit confirmation
- Comprehensive audit logging for all administrative actions

### ✅ Development Environment Standardization
- Proper development seed data system
- Standardized authentication tokens
- Environment validation throughout
- Clean development fixture management

## API Endpoints Created

### Development APIs (`/api/dev/`)
- `GET /auth-info` - Development authentication documentation
- `GET /validate-token` - Token validation
- `GET /setup-status` - Development setup status
- `GET /oakland-status` - Oakland Cougars specific status
- `POST /setup-test-user` - Oakland Cougars user setup
- `POST /reset-oakland-cougars` - Reset development environment
- `POST /seed-teams` - Create development teams
- `POST /seed-complete` - Complete environment setup

### Emergency Admin APIs (`/api/admin/emergency/`)
- `GET /auth-info` - Emergency authentication documentation
- `POST /fix-team-contracts/:teamId` - Emergency contract fixes
- `POST /fix-team-players/:teamId` - Emergency player fixes
- `POST /move-team-subdivision` - Team subdivision moves
- `POST /reset-division-subdivision` - Division/subdivision reset

## Security Features Implemented
