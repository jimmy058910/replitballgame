# Step 5 Docker Fix Applied

## Issue Fixed
Docker build was failing at line 51 due to invalid COPY syntax:
```
ERROR: failed to calculate checksum: "/||": not found
```

## Root Cause
The Dockerfile contained invalid shell redirection in COPY command:
```dockerfile
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public 2>/dev/null || true
```

Docker COPY commands don't support shell operators like `2>/dev/null` or `||`.

## Solution Applied
Fixed the syntax by using standard Docker commands:
```dockerfile
# Copy static assets if they exist (using RUN to handle optional copy)
RUN mkdir -p ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
```

## Ready for Deployment
- ✅ Docker syntax error fixed
- ✅ Step 5 real-time server with authentic Realm Rivalry mechanics ready
- ✅ Dockerfile.step5-websocket corrected

## Next Steps
Commit the fix and trigger new Step 5 deployment:
```bash
git add Dockerfile.step5-websocket
git commit -m "Fix Docker syntax error in Step 5 deployment"
git push origin main
```

This will trigger the Step 5 deployment workflow again with the corrected Dockerfile.
