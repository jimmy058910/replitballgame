## How to File for a Federal Trademark

Filing is done through the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).

### Step 1: Conduct a Clearance Search ‚≠ê **CRUCIAL FIRST STEP**

Before filing, ensure your name and logo are not already in use or confusingly similar to existing trademarks.

#### Search Process:
1. **USPTO TESS Database**: Use Trademark Electronic Search System
2. **Search Terms**: "Realm Rivalry" and variations (Real Rivalry, Realm Rivarly, etc.)
3. **Similar Games**: Search games with similar themes, fantasy sports, management games
4. **Domain Analysis**: Check domain registrations and common law trademarks

#### Why Critical:
- **#1 Rejection Reason**: Most applications fail due to "likelihood of confusion"
- **Cost Avoidance**: Prevents wasting money on doomed applications
- **Strategic Planning**: Allows for brand adjustments before launch

#### Professional Recommendation:
**Consider hiring an IP attorney** for comprehensive search and analysis. They excel at:
- Conducting thorough searches across multiple databases
- Analyzing "likelihood of confusion" risks
- Evaluating overall registrability chances
- Providing strategic guidance on brand development

### Step 2: Prepare Your Trademark Application

File online via USPTO's TEAS (Trademark Electronic Application System) portal.

## Part 2: Copyright (Protecting Your Creative Work)

Copyright protects the actual creative expression of your game. It's about the content itself.

### What Copyright Protects
- **Source Code**: All programming code and scripts
- **Artwork**: Character designs, environmental art, UI elements
- **Audio**: Music, sound effects, voice acting
- **Story Elements**: Narrative, dialogue, character backgrounds
- **Audiovisual Work**: The combined interactive experience

### Why File Copyright Registration

**Automatic vs. Registered:**

- **Registration Benefits**: Required to file lawsuit in the US
- **Enhanced Remedies**: Statutory damages and attorney's fees available
- **Legal Presumptions**: Registration creates legal presumptions of ownership

### Step 3: Complete Online Application

2. **Start New Application**: Select appropriate work type
3. **Work Classification**: 
   - **"Computer Program"** (covers all elements)
