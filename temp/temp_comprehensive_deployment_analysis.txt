## COMPREHENSIVE DEPLOYMENT FIX NEEDED

BUILD ISSUES:
❌ timezones.json missing from shared/ directory (FATAL error)
❌ Container builds but missing critical runtime files

STARTUP ISSUES:  
❌ Signal 11 segmentation fault during container startup
❌ Old startup probe settings still being used (30s delay instead of 60s)

MEMORY ISSUES:
❌ NODE_OPTIONS memory limit may not be sufficient for Prisma + complex app

SOLUTION APPROACH:
1. Create missing timezones.json file
2. Commit and push to trigger new deployment with updated startup probe settings  
3. Monitor for Signal 11 resolution with memory safety measures
