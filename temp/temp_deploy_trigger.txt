ðŸš€ COMPREHENSIVE CLOUD RUN DEPLOYMENT FIX

Based on extensive web research of Cloud Run deployment issues:

CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
âœ… Server timeout: httpServer.setTimeout(0) + keepAlive settings
âœ… Host binding: ENV HOST=0.0.0.0 for Cloud Run compatibility  
âœ… Startup probe: Optimized timeoutSeconds=3, periodSeconds=8, failureThreshold=15
âœ… Health endpoints: Multiple fast endpoints (/health, /healthz, /readyz, /ping)
âœ… Container logging: Enhanced startup verification and debugging
âœ… Docker platform: Verified --platform linux/amd64 specification
âœ… Network binding: Server binds to 0.0.0.0:8080 (not 127.0.0.1)
âœ… Port Configuration: Fixed production port binding logic

RESEARCH FOUNDATION:
- Google Cloud Run "No logs available" solutions
- Node.js Express health check best practices
- Container startup probe failure troubleshooting
- Industry-standard Cloud Run deployment patterns

EXPECTED OUTCOME: Resolves persistent startup probe timeouts and "No logs available" errors

Total startup time: 10s + (15 Ã— 8s) = 130s with faster individual probes
