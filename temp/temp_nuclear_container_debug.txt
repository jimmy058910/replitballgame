🚨 NUCLEAR CONTAINER DEBUGGING APPROACH (Aug 8, 2025)

CRITICAL ISSUE ANALYSIS:
❌ Container consistently fails to start Node.js process
❌ "No logs available" = Node.js never begins execution
❌ Status remains "Unknown" despite generous 220-second startup window

COMPREHENSIVE FIXES ATTEMPTED:
✅ Port configuration (--port 8080 + httpGet.port=8080) 
✅ Extended startup probe timeouts (220 seconds total)
✅ Build system verification (dist/server/index.js exists)
✅ Container architecture (linux/amd64, proper copying)
✅ Health endpoint implementation (/healthz working locally)

NUCLEAR DEBUGGING CHANGES:
🔧 Removed dumb-init to isolate Node.js startup
🔧 Added file permission verification at multiple stages
🔧 Added content verification of entry file before execution
🔧 Simplified CMD to direct Node.js invocation

HYPOTHESIS:
- File permissions issue with non-root user
- ES modules compatibility with Cloud Run
- Container runtime environment issue

This deployment will provide maximum debugging information for container startup failure analysis.
