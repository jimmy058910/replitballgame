## Deployment Time Analysis

13+ minutes for 'Deploy Green revision (0% traffic)' suggests:

1. **Secret Access Issues**: Container may be repeatedly failing startup probe
2. **Resource Allocation**: Cloud Run may be struggling to allocate 4Gi memory + 2 CPU
3. **Startup Probe Timeout**: 30s initial delay + 5s timeout Ã— 20 failures = potential 2+ minute retry cycles
4. **Image Pull Issues**: Large container image may be slow to download

RECOMMENDATION: Check Cloud Run logs during deployment for:
- 'Secret not found' errors
- 'Startup probe failed' messages  
- 'Resource allocation failed' warnings
- Container crash loops with Signal 11 errors
