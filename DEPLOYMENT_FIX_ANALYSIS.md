# üîß Deployment Fix Analysis - Step 1 Express Minimal

## üîç **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

**Issue**: GitHub Actions workflow failed during build step due to missing environment variables.

**Error Details**:
```
PROJECT_ID: 
PROJECT_NUMBER: 
IMAGE_NAME: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev//realm-rivalry/express-minimal
```

**Analysis**:
- Workflow tried to use `${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}` which doesn't exist
- Workflow tried to use `${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_NUMBER }}` which doesn't exist  
- This caused empty PROJECT_ID and malformed IMAGE_NAME with double slash `//`
- Authentication was working correctly via `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

**Fixed Environment Variables**:
```yaml
env:
  PROJECT_ID: direct-glider-465821-p7          # Hardcoded working project ID
  PROJECT_NUMBER: 465821                       # Hardcoded project number
  IMAGE_NAME: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/direct-glider-465821-p7/realm-rivalry/express-minimal
```

**Why This Works**:
- `direct-glider-465821-p7` is confirmed working from auth logs
- Authentication via `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` remains functional
- Image path construction will be correct

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Re-run the fixed workflow**
   - GitHub Actions ‚Üí "Deploy Express Minimal (Step 1)" 
   - Should now pass the build stage

2. **If still failing**: Examine next failure point systematically

3. **If successful**: Move to Step 2 (Express + Database)

## üìã **SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING APPROACH**

This demonstrates the value of our systematic build-up:
- ‚úÖ Minimal HTTP server works (confirmed)
- üîß Express minimal server - fixing deployment issues
- ‚è≥ Express + Database - next step when current issue resolved

We're methodically identifying and fixing each layer of complexity.
