# DEPLOYMENT #105 - SUCCESS WITH HEALTH CHECK FIX NEEDED

**DATE:** August 9, 2025  
**STATUS:** ✅ DEPLOYMENT SUCCEEDED - Secret mapping fix worked!

## SUCCESS CONFIRMATION:
✅ Container built successfully  
✅ Revision created: realm-rivalry-backend-de3efddb  
✅ Deployed with 0% traffic (Blue-Green pattern)  
✅ Available at: https://green---realm-rivalry-backend-o6fd46yesq-uc.a.run.app  
✅ Secret mapping fix resolved all previous failures

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
❌ Health check failed due to gcloud CLI syntax error:
`ERROR: (gcloud.run.services.describe) unrecognized arguments: --filter=status.traffic[0].tag=green`

## FIX APPLIED:
- Replaced problematic gcloud filter command with direct URL construction
- Health check will now use the known tagged URL format

## NEXT STEPS:
1. Deploy #106 with health check fix
2. Complete Blue-Green traffic promotion 
3. Verify full deployment success

**BREAKTHROUGH:** The secret naming issue has been completely resolved!
