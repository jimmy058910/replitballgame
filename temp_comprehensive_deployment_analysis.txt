COMPREHENSIVE DEPLOYMENT ISSUES ANALYSIS
==========================================

✅ ISSUE #1: Port Binding Mismatch (ALREADY FIXED)
- Problem: Deployment hardcoded `--port 8080` vs dynamic PORT
- Status: FIXED - Removed hardcoded port configurations

❌ ISSUE #2: DATABASE_URL Secret Name Mismatch (CRITICAL)
- Deployment config: `DATABASE_URL=database-url:latest`
- Code expects: `DATABASE_URL_PRODUCTION` (server/routes/debug-env.ts:20-21)
- Impact: Database connection will fail in production
- Fix needed: Change secret name in deployment

❌ ISSUE #3: Missing SESSION_SECRET (CRITICAL)
- Code requires: `SESSION_SECRET` (server/replitAuth.ts, server/utils/securityValidator.ts)
- Deployment config: Missing from --set-secrets
- Impact: Session management will fail
- Fix needed: Add SESSION_SECRET to deployment secrets

❌ ISSUE #4: Startup Probe Too Aggressive (MEDIUM)
- Current: initialDelaySeconds=30, failureThreshold=20, periodSeconds=10
- Problem: Only 200 seconds total timeout, 30s initial delay too short
- Impact: May fail healthy containers due to slow startup
- Fix needed: Increase delays and timeouts

❌ ISSUE #5: Resource Allocation Insufficient (MEDIUM)
- Current: 2Gi memory, 2 CPU
- Problem: Complex app with Prisma, Sentry, WebSockets may need more
- Impact: Out of memory crashes during startup
- Fix needed: Increase to 4Gi memory

❌ ISSUE #6: Build Verification Missing (LOW)
- Current: No verification that all required files exist in container
- Problem: Missing files cause silent startup failures
- Impact: Container starts but fails to serve requests
- Fix needed: Add verification steps to Dockerfile

NEXT ACTIONS:
1. Fix DATABASE_URL secret name mismatch
2. Add SESSION_SECRET to deployment
3. Adjust startup probe timings
4. Increase memory allocation
5. Add build verification steps
