  "conclusion": "Successfully addressed key Prisma field mismatch patterns and type assignment errors. Enhanced core interfaces with missing properties used across the application. Fixed systematic string/number conversion issues and enum alignment problems. While net error count remained stable due to cascade effects, the foundational type improvements will enable easier fixes in subsequent iterations."
