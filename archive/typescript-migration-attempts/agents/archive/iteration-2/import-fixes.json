  "insights": [
    "Most duplicate errors stem from importing same types from both Prisma client and shared types",
    "Logger duplicates follow consistent pattern across league service files",
    "Payment types were completely missing from type system - good addition for future consistency",
    "44 duplicate fixes represent 56% of all duplicate errors - very high impact approach",
    "Service layer has systematic type import issues that should be addressed architecturally"
  ],
  "remainingWork": [
    "34 duplicate errors still remain - mostly in storage layer and other service files",
    "17 missing import errors remain - likely lazy loading components and undefined variables",
    "OptimizedDashboard lazy loading components need resolution or removal",
    "Some files may have architectural issues requiring design decisions"
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Continue systematic duplicate import fixes in remaining service files",
    "Address lazy loading component imports or remove unused code",
    "Consider architectural review of import patterns in storage layer"
