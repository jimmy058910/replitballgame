Fixed Player interface conflict in Game.ts by removing duplicate Player interface import (keeping Player class import).

Removed duplicate Team and TeamFinances imports from typeGuards.ts (removed from @shared/types/api, kept from @shared/types/models). Removed local Team interface definition from Team.tsx (17-line interface replaced with existing import from @shared/types/models).",
