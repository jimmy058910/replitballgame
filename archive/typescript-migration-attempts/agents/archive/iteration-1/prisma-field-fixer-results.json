  "observations": [
    "Error count remained at 529, indicating Prisma field fixes are part of a larger TypeScript migration effort",
    "Many field mappings were already correctly applied in the codebase",
    "Key fixes applied to high-impact files identified in analysis results",
    "homeTeam.name/awayTeam.name issues require include relation fixes rather than simple field renames",
    "Some issues may be masked by other TypeScript errors that need resolution first"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "The stable error count suggests these fixes address structural issues that will show benefit after other agents complete",
    "Import fixes should be applied before measuring full impact of field fixes", 
    "homeTeam/awayTeam relation issues need query include fixes in standings repository",
    "Additional field mappings may be needed after duplicate interface cleanup",
    "Consider running field fixes again after import and interface consolidation"
