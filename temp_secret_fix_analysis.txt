## Secret Name Fix Analysis - August 10, 2025

### Root Cause
Error log showed: "Could not fetch secret google-client-secret" but workflow used GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET.

### Mixed Secret Naming Pattern Discovered
From SECRET_MAPPING_REFERENCE.md:
- Some secrets use UPPERCASE: GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, etc.
- Some secrets use lowercase-hyphenated: firebase-api-key, firebase-project-id

### Error Details
- Request tried: projects/direct-glider-465821-p7/secrets/google-client-secret
- Error showed: projects/108005641993/secrets/google-client-secret not found
- This suggests PROJECT_ID vs PROJECT_NUMBER confusion

### Fix Applied
1. Changed secret references back to documented format from SECRET_MAPPING_REFERENCE.md
2. Use PROJECT_ID directly instead of PROJECT_NUMBER to avoid confusion
3. Added secret verification step to catch naming issues early

### Expected Resolution
This should resolve the "Secret not found" errors during Cloud Run deployment.
