DEPLOYMENT SECRET MAPPING FIX - Deployment #105

PROBLEM RESOLVED:
- Deployment workflow was looking for incorrectly named secrets in Google Cloud
- User's actual Google Cloud secrets have different names

SECRET MAPPING CORRECTIONS:
❌ Old (incorrect): realm-rivalry-database-url
✅ New (correct): DATABASE_URL

❌ Old (incorrect): realm-rivalry-session-secret  
✅ New (correct): SESSION_SECRET

❌ Old (incorrect): realm-rivalry-google-client-id
✅ New (correct): GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID

❌ Old (incorrect): realm-rivalry-google-client-secret
✅ New (correct): GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

✅ Already correct: firebase-api-key
✅ Already correct: firebase-project-id  
✅ Already correct: firebase-app-id

SERVICE ACCOUNT CONFIRMATION:
✅ Using: realm-rivalry-github-runner@direct-glider-465821-p7.iam.gserviceaccount.com
✅ Has active keys (created Jul 31, 2025 and Aug 2, 2025)

NEXT STEPS:
1. User needs to add GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY to Replit secrets (JSON key content)
2. Deploy and test - should work with correct secret mapping

STATUS: Ready for deployment once GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY is added
