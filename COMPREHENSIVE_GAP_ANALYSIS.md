# COMPREHENSIVE GAP ANALYSIS: User Documentation vs Current Implementation
*Generated: July 1, 2025*

## SYSTEM 1: ADVANCED TEAM TACTICS & STRATEGY SYSTEM

### ‚úÖ CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
- **Database Fields**: `fieldSize` and `tacticalFocus` exist in teams table
- **Field Size Options**: Standard, Large, Small (implemented)

### ‚ùå MISSING IMPLEMENTATIONS
- **Gameplay Effects Implementation**: Field size effects not integrated into match simulation
  - Large Field: Pass range increase + stamina depletion increase
  - Small Field: Blocker engagement radius + power bonus + pass accuracy penalty
- **AI Behavior Modifications**: Tactical focus doesn't actually change AI behavior
  - All-Out Attack: Deeper routes, riskier passes, forward positioning
  - Defensive Wall: Conservative positioning, safer passes, deeper defense

  - Losing Big: "Desperate Measures" behavior  
  - Late & Close: "Clutch Time" camaraderie effects
- **Coach Integration**: Head Coach tactics stat doesn't modify tactical effectiveness
