## DEPLOYMENT FIX SUMMARY

ISSUE: Secret Manager secrets exist with lowercase names, but deployment was trying to reference uppercase secret names.

SOLUTION:
✅ Fixed secret mapping to reference existing lowercase secrets:
   - DATABASE_URL_PRODUCTION env var maps to 'database-url' secret
   - SESSION_SECRET env var maps to 'session-secret' secret

✅ Added memory safety with NODE_OPTIONS to prevent Signal 11 crashes

✅ Environment variables in code (uppercase) now correctly map to existing Secret Manager secrets (lowercase)

This should resolve both the 'secret not found' error and the segmentation fault issues.
