# DEPLOYMENT FAILURE RESOLUTION - Firebase Secrets Missing

## Root Cause
The backend deployment failed because Firebase secrets don't exist in Google Cloud Secret Manager:
- `firebase-api-key` 
- `firebase-project-id`
- `firebase-app-id`

**Error Message:**
```
Secret projects/108005641993/secrets/firebase-api-key/versions/latest was not found
Secret projects/108005641993/secrets/firebase-project-id/versions/latest was not found  
Secret projects/108005641993/secrets/firebase-app-id/versions/latest was not found
```

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Create Firebase Secrets in Google Cloud
Run this in **Google Cloud Shell** (not GitHub Actions):

```bash
# 1. Open Google Cloud Shell at console.cloud.google.com
# 2. Set the Firebase environment variables:

export VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="[USER_NEEDS_TO_SET_THIS]"
export VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="[USER_NEEDS_TO_SET_THIS]"  
export VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="[USER_NEEDS_TO_SET_THIS]"

# 3. Run the secret creation script:
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimmy058910/replitballgame/main/create-firebase-secrets.sh | bash
```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend
After secrets are created, run the GitHub Actions workflow:
```
GitHub Actions → "Deploy Production Optimized Backend" → Run workflow
```

## Alternative: Manual Secret Creation

If the script doesn't work, create secrets manually in Google Cloud Console:

1. Go to **Secret Manager** in Google Cloud Console
2. Create these secrets:
   - Name: `firebase-api-key`, Value: `[Firebase API Key]`
   - Name: `firebase-project-id`, Value: `[Firebase Project ID]`
   - Name: `firebase-app-id`, Value: `[Firebase App ID]`
3. Grant access to service account: `realm-rivalry-github-runner@direct-glider-465821-p7.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

## Verification
Check that secrets exist:
```bash
gcloud secrets list --project=direct-glider-465821-p7
```

Should show:
- firebase-api-key
- firebase-project-id  
- firebase-app-id
- database-url

## Next Steps
Once secrets are created:
1. Deploy backend: **GitHub Actions → Deploy Production Optimized Backend**
2. Deploy frontend: **GitHub Actions → Frontend Only - Firebase Deploy**
